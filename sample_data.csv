Argentina,"Leather, blueberry, blackberry and mild herbal notes make for a rich, ribald bouquet. Given the nose, it's no surprise that this Malbec is dense, jammy and a bit oversaturated in the mouth. Flavors of blackberry, prune, mint and graphite finish with lushness. Drink now through 2016.",91,34.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Pascual Toso
France,"A big, rich style of Sancerre, but one that doesn't forget its mineral, flinty roots. The acidity has an edge of sweetness, opened by delicious berry fruit flavors, tangy in its citrus freshness. It could age for another 1–2 years.",90,24.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Masson-Blondelet
US,"With hard, astringent tannins that give a dry scrubbing to the palate, this Cab isn't offering immediate pleasure, despite a core of ripe blackberry and cherry fruit. The question is, where's it going?",84,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trueblood
US,"This is built to impress through its sheer power. With a little Petit Verdot blended in, which adds a floral character, it's marked by an intense flavor of ripe wild blackberries, with a dried berry quality that's suggestive of currants and a liqueur fullness, courtesy of the high alcohol. The French oak is a full 100% new, and is in keeping with the wine's volume. So rich and tannic now, it's barely drinkable. Give it at least 6–8 years in a good cellar and see what happens.",94,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,David Arthur
France,"From Vendôme on the River Loir north of the Loire itself, this is a dry, lightly perfumed wine with a tight tannic edge as well as bright citrus and pink grapefruit flavors. A rosé for food.",86,24.0,Loire Valley,Coteaux du Vendômois,Pineau d'Aunis,Les Vignerons du Vendômois
US,"Don't reject this Syrah, Petite Sirah and Cabernet blend because it's non-vintage. So are many great Champagnes. Made from the 2006 and 2007 vintages, it's absolutely delicious, so stuffed with blackberry, black currant and bacon flavors, you can't help but be impressed. It's also very young and fresh in acids and tannins, so give it a year or two in order to knit together.",93,65.0,California,Paso Robles,Red Blend,Falcone
US,"Tannic and earthy, with tobacco, sage, blackberry, currant and cedar flavors. The structure shows some real elegance and balance. Could develop bottle complexity for a few years.",87,25.0,California,Paso Robles,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Hidden Oak
Argentina,"Hard black fruit and notes of tire rubber and tar indicate that this is a dark, masculine wine. And while it does offer power, it's actually quite racy and balanced in the mouth. Flavorwise, expect black raspberry and some bitter cocoa. Overall, there's nothing unripe about it.",88,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Luigi Bosca
US,"Soft and delicious, if a little one-dimensional. No denying the lushness of the pineapple, orange and golden apricot fruit flavors, or the pretty spices. Sémillon adds a cashew nut oiliness. Could use greater dryness and acidity.",87,27.0,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Duckhorn
US,"Plump and juicy flavors of bramble, red currant and raspberry lead into a smooth, satisfying middle with a streak of caramel running right through it. Excellent flavor and persistence for such a young wine. Just a little thin as it fades.",89,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Grenache,Novelty Hill
Italy,"Here's an easy-going and traditional expression of Barbera that is not overstated or exaggerated in any way. In fact, fruit intensity is measured and the wine presents an informal, no-fuss but elegant front. You'll get aromas of cherry, blackberry and spice.",86,11.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,Barbera,Palladino
France,"A deep ruby wine with brilliant reflections. It has a youthful, fruit-driven nose backed by mineral undertones. Opulent bramble fruit appears on the nose, with blueberry flavors on the palate highlighted by a dusting of cocoa powder. Supple and smooth tannins finish lightly dusty and moderate acidity aids the medium finish. Drink now–2015.",90,24.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Corbières,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine la Bouysse
Italy,"There's a crisp, easy quality to this metodo classico Italian sparkler that makes it ideal for smoked salmon or raw tuna appetizers. The wine is lean and bright with a fine note of citrus and lime on the finish.",87,24.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,Sparkling Blend,Tenuta Montedelma di Berardi
Australia,"A Yarra Valley classic, Dry Red No. 1 is a Bordeaux-style blend marked by its restrained alcohol levels yet potent flavors. The 2007 features scents of tobacco, vanilla and cassis, with a hint of tomato emerging on the palate. It's medium-bodied, with a long finish that finishes with firm but silky tannins and lip-smacking cassis. Approachable now, but should age well for 10–15 years.",92,75.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,Red Blend,Yarra Yering
US,"Still dry and tannic, this has a hard, brittle mouthfeel and lots of tart acidity. It has a gigantic core of blackberry fruit.",87,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Houdini
Australia,"This is a big, loud Shiraz, bursting with blackberry fruit and scents of cola, vanilla and toast. The flavors favor blackberries but also blend in hints of fruitcake and spice that easily conceal its 14.9% alcohol. Long and lush on the finish, this is delicious now but should also hold at least five years.",91,30.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,Shiraz,Chapel Hill
US,"Big and bold, a ripe, oaky Chardonnay that needs some time in the cellar to come together. Offers tiers of apricot, pear, peach and nectarine flavors, with a stony minerality and crisp acidity that makes the mouth water. Bone dry and complex, this Chablisian Chardonnay will blossom some time in 2010.",92,30.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay,Fess Parker
US,"Apricots, grapefruits, apples, figs, peaches, melons—there's a whole orchard in this dry, crisp PG. It has a particular savory character from the citrusy acids. What a great price for this wine.",86,10.0,California,California,Pinot Grigio,McManis
US,"Fruity and spritzy, this fragrant, screwcapped Chardonnay is scented with apples, pears, a hint of grapefruit and spice. It's front-loaded, nicely balanced at 13% alcohol, and best enjoyed lightly chilled.",87,15.0,Oregon,Oregon,Chardonnay,A to Z
Australia,"Seems a bit dilute, with low-intensity flavors of cherries and herbs. Clean and fresh; could use more weight and richness.",83,21.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,Cabernet Sauvignon,Evans & Tate
Argentina,"Yellowish in color, with a heavy, somewhat creamy nose that deals vanilla and melon. More sweet vanilla is woven into the anonymous fruit flavors, while slight oakiness rears up on the finish. Not bad but oaky and unfocused.",84,13.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Chardonnay,Domaine Jean Bousquet
Italy,"Here's a modern, plush and extracted expression of Sangiovese Grosso that has been enhanced by elegant oak aging. Still young, it exhibits notes of vanilla, toasted coconut, smoke and resin along with a solid base of cassis and dried berry fruit. The texture here is polished and smooth with zesty spice on the close.",94,96.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese Grosso,Poggio Antico
France,"This is a big, smoky wine that's packed with ripe fruits, firm tannins and layers of wood. Firm, solid and concentrated, the wine's black fruits show through the dense texture. It has great potential—age for at least five years.",94,195.0,Burgundy,Echézeaux,Pinot Noir,Domaines Devillard
US,"Broad and generous, this Pinot appeals for its lush flavors of black cherries, mocha, cola, sweet rhubarb pie and smoky oak. It's jammy and somewhat tannic, and should soften and sweeten with up to six years of aging.",90,48.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir,Tandem
US,"Beautiful, irresistable Syrah, lush and sweet in fruit and oak. Soft and velvety, it offers layers of puréed raspberries, cherries, blackberries, blueberries and chocolate, with a rich edge of toasted marshmallow, gingerbread and butterscotch. Yet it's dry, with modest alcohol.",94,27.0,California,Russian River Valley,Syrah,Novy
US,"Bright, brash fruit sets this off on the right note, with raspberries and strawberries and even a little watermelon in the mix. Fruit defines the middle, and extends through to the full, ripe finish.",87,22.0,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel,Martin & Weyrich
Italy,I was delighted to find more evolved pastry shop smells like baked apple and cinnamon instead of the simple floral and exotic fruit aromas usually associated with Alto Adige. A great effect in the mouth: The wine is crisp and coats evenly. Imported by Total Wine & More.,87,13.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,Pinot Grigio,Kupelwieser
US,"This hits the palate rather hard and green, with thin fruit that does not seem quite ripe. The barrel flavors add fat and caramel over the top, but remain unintegrated and seem out of place. The wine reverts to its green side as the tannins take over.",84,24.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Merlot,Skylite
Spain,"A bit tan and dull to the eye, with neutral aromas of apple cider and peach. The palate is wet, uncomplicated and simple, with basic apple flavors that some might consider to be bland. Solid on the finish, with papaya for flavor.",84,8.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,Viura-Chardonnay,Vega Sindoa
US,"Made in a lighter style, this Paso blend has cherry, red currant, violet and sandalwood flavors. There are some pretty hard tannins, but they're refined. Basically a Bordeaux blend with a splash of Syrah.",85,28.0,California,Paso Robles,Red Blend,D'Anbino
US,"A good everyday wine. It's dry, full-bodied and has enough berry-cherry flavors to get by, wrapped into a smooth texture.",84,10.0,California,California,Merlot,Montevina
Argentina,"Features intoxicating pastry, blueberry, cola and coffee aromas in front of a minerally, terroir-packed palate of soft black fruit, chocolate, fine herbs and other character-aiding touches. The mouthfeel is fabulous and the finish of Swiss chocolate and integrated spice is as smooth as silk. Drink now through 2011.",96,123.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
Spain,"Aromas of saline, citrus fruit, passion fruit and mustard are pithy and show pyrazines. Following the nose, this is citric in feel, with orange peel and grapefruit flavors. A grassy, slightly bitter finish is snappy and suggests fresh scallion.",86,19.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,Verdejo,De Alberto
Italy,"Steady and focused, this has tight aromas of blackberry and spice that open and evolve the longer the wine stays in the glass. There's a touch of sweet strawberry on the finish.",90,50.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,Red Blend,Fabiano
US,"Simple, sweet and oaky, this Chard has ripe flavors of tropical fruits, pears, lemon tarts and vanilla. It's fine for big parties where Chard is in demand.",82,10.0,California,Sonoma County,Chardonnay,Sonoma Creek
US,"Sonoma Cabernet specialist Cohn turns his attention to Pinot, with good results. The wine is dry, silky and interesting, showing an array of cherry, cola, tobacco and peppery spice flavors. Has enough of a complex tannin structure to pair with lamb chops, or a great grilled salmon steak.",90,40.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,B.R. Cohn
US,"You'll find thick tannins and soft acidity in this wine, which offers direct, jammy blackberry and cassis flavors. It's quite a rich wine that seems best now and for the next few years.",87,40.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Cabernet Sauvignon,Fernwood
Spain,"Light melon and vanilla aromas are simple yet muddled, while the green melon and lemon flavors are not overly generous but acceptable. A narrow wine with a lean figure and protruding acidity.",82,10.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,Verdejo,Solar de la Vega
Argentina,"Cherry, cassis and spice aromas are mild and comported. The wine feels chewy and just dense enough, with baked cassis, berry and herb flavors that finish toasty and hot, with a rubbery note. Clean aromas and full fruit flavors are this wine's best attributes.",87,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hacienda del Plata
Italy,"This ripasso by Cesari presents a solid wall of black fruit, prune, plum and blackberry on the nose. The wine is dense and luscious with thick layers of ripe fruit and spice. Pair it with barbecued pork ribs.",91,24.0,Veneto,Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Cesari
Argentina,"This has apple and nectarine aromas that are a touch briny. It shows good acidity and mouthfeel, with flavors of apple, peach and even some green bean.",85,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Chardonnay,Trapiche
France,"A lively, almost racy wine that has delicious ripe fruit, lovely fresh acidity, lemon and green-apple flavors and an appealing layer of new wood. Chardonnay lovers, this is for you.",92,70.0,Burgundy,Chassagne-Montrachet,Chardonnay,Domaine Bernard Moreau et Fils
US,"Made from organic grapes and packaged in a 500-ml Tetra Pak, this Chard is made from ripe fruit with a toasty caramel molasses halo around it, and finishes sweet. It would be quite drinkable on a camping trip or tailgate party.",85,7.0,California,Mendocino,Chardonnay,CalNaturale
US,"A brilliant Chardonnay showing how well this region can ripen fruit while retaining brisk acidity. Oak barrels add an exotic touch of clove to the underlying pineapple fruit flavors. Feels rich and creamy, and aging on the lees provides a complex touch of sourdough. Drink now.",93,45.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay,Foley
US,"Winemaker Eric Dunham was the first to latch onto the fruit coming from this exceptional site in the Rattlesnake Hills, and this is as good as any Syrah made in Washington. An awesome nose with spectacular intensity spills out of the glass, carrying superb raspberry scents. The wine is crisp and focused, intense and nuanced. Flavors float from raspberry into the cherry cola realm, heading for a lingering, elegant finish.",94,75.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah,Dunham
Italy,"Made with sweetly fragrant Malvasia grapes from the tiny island of Salina off the northern coast of Sicily, this Passito dessert wine opens with all the intensity you'd expect of sunny southern Italy. The wine sports a luminous amber color and aromas of candied fruit or orange rind, dried mint, touches of root beer and even a hint of white licorice.",88,40.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Malvasia delle Lipari,Malvasia,Colosi
US,"What this wine needs is more acidic crispness. The flavors are totally delicious, the texture is elegant, the finish is totally dry, but the superripe cherries, raspberries, cocoa and cola just sort of melt into the palate, then fade away.",86,55.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir,Manzanita Creek
Australia,"A well made 50-50 blend, this is loaded with black fruit. Perfect balance, a velvety mouthfeel and a long finish are other attributes. Food-wise, prime rib would be just fine. Best Buy.",87,7.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz,Alice White
Italy,"This is a delicate Rosso di Montalcino with aromas of red berry, almond and cola. It's short and compact in the mouth but offers good freshness that could match simple chicken or pork dishes. Drink now.",86,26.0,Tuscany,Rosso di Montalcino,Sangiovese Grosso,Podere Paganico
US,"Tart berry flavors, tangy acids, and subtle barrel flavors of caramel and clove bring complexity and detail to this well-balanced, ageworthy wine.",91,54.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Pinot Noir,Winderlea
Italy,"This is a very likeable and approachable Brunello with soft but generous tones of cherry fruit, exotic spice, pipe tobacco and cedar wood. In fact, those exotic wood notes transfer to the mouth where the wine is smooth and enduring with a sweet cherry finale.",90,60.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese Grosso,Capanna
France,"This is a firm wine, showing the tannins of the vintage while also bringing out ripe fruit to balance. It shows tense acidity with a juicy edge and follows through with a sense of potential richness. This has all the  elements for good aging.",90,25.0,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Fontesteau
US,"This simple Merlot offers plenty of semi-sweet chocolate, raspberry, red currant and sandalwood flavors. What it's lacking is structure. Tasty, but needs greater acidity and tannins for balance.",84,24.0,California,Napa-Sonoma,Merlot,Artesa
France,"Light and bright, this is a direct and easygoing rosé, with attractive aromas and flavors of red currant, ruby-red grapefruit rind, white melon and peach. The medium-weight palate is lifted by refreshing, citrus-flavored acidity, ending with an orange and strawberry-hull fueled finish.",86,10.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Sable de Camargue,Rosé,Listel
US,"Made with organically grown grapes, and harvested rather late (end of October) from vineyards in the Horse Heaven Hills, this is a surprisingly substantial, earthy offering. Raspberry and cherry fruit flavors are laced with graphite and iron ore, and some black olive herbal character adds interest to the finish.",87,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot,Snoqualmie
US,"Smells funky. Although it's richer in the mouth, with blackberry, currant and cedar flavors, it's hard to get beyond that not-quite-clean smell. Something's tamping down the fruit, leaving behind alcohol and oak.",82,58.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Townley
US,"Made in a drier, more tannic style compared to some top Napa Cabs, this Bordeaux blend is elegant rather than opulent. It has red currant, licorice and new oak flavors framed by hard, astringent tannins. Could develop with bottle age after 2011.",88,75.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon,J. Davies
US,"This creamy and delicious blend of 80% Petite Sirah, 10% Syrah and 10% Mourvèdre truly outperforms all its parts. It offers high tones of red fruit, earthy licorice and tamed tobacco. Medium in body with well-behaved tannins, it has a dusty finish that's very appealing.",89,35.0,California,Lodi,Red Blend,Borra
Spain,"This smells rubbery and gritty, with notes of gas and leather. It feels acidic and drawing but healthy, with earthy red-berry flavors. Dry and peppy, there's still not a lot of style or character to the wine.",84,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo Blend,Federico Paternina
Italy,"This blend of Grecanico and Viognier offers a generous bouquet with exotic fruit, pineapple, white flower and dusty talc powder. The wine also shows creamy thickness in the mouth.",87,25.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,White Blend,Settesoli
US,"This is a well-made, balanced effort with green apple fruit enhanced with hints of honey and allspice. Still quite young and tight, it is just beginning to soften up and show some nice toasted, roasted nuts in the finish. It isn't quite as intense as the Barrel Fermented Chardonnay from CSM; this is a slightly softer, more approachable wine.",87,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay,Chateau Ste. Michelle
Italy,"This cleanses the palate thanks to its alcohol and acidity, and aromas of red cherry, cedar and cinnamon. Pair this savory effort with spicy marinated pork or lamb.",88,24.0,Veneto,Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Secondo Marco
US,"After the wonderful 2005 vintage, this is a bit of a letdown, which undoubtedly is a reflection of the vintage. It's very rich and the tannins are superb, but there's a jammy sweetness to the blackberries and cherries. It's a delicious wine, but could be drier and have a more complex structure. Now through 2012.",88,100.0,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon,Oakville East
US,"A fairly standard Zin that plays it right down the middle. It's dry, clean and spicy, with wild berry and tobacco flavors wrapped into smooth tannins. Drink now.",86,15.0,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel,Sebastiani
US,"This wine is a blend of top sites Les Collines, SJR and Red Willow. It's perfumed with notes of green olive, violets, dried herbs, mineral and smoked meat. The palate is tightly wound, sensuous and supple, lithe yet rich with tart fruit and savory flavors backed by tannins that need more time to come into their own—but this wine surely deserves it. It has all of the stuffing to be a 20+ year wine. Best from 2025 to 2032. Give it an extended decant if opening in the near term.",95,85.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Syrah,Gramercy
US,"The climate of New Mexico seems to suit the Viognier grape. Here it has given it a lovely, intense perfume of gardenia, orange blossom and guava. Though broad and soft in the mouth, enough acid comes through on the finish to save it from flabbiness. Serve as an apéritif.",86,20.0,New Mexico,New Mexico,Viognier,La Chiripada
Australia,"Toasty and nutty upfront, with hints of minerality showing through, this is a refined Chardonnay that should have the structure to age. Despite being barrel-fermented, there's no malolactic fermentation, so it stays crisp through the long finish that barely hints at pear and peach.",90,85.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,Chardonnay,Mount Mary
US,"Ripe, round, toasty wine, with rich, plummy fruit and a full-throttle palate feel. Nicely made and surprisingly evolved; jammy and pleasure-packed. Finishes with a pleasing fruit sweetness.",90,21.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Zinfandel,Villa Mt. Eden
US,"Dry and a little unripe, this has a vegetal streak that compromises the nectarine and citrus flavors. A fine burst of acidity makes the mouth water. The blend is mainly Sémillon, with a little Sauvignon Blanc.",85,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Palazzo Wine
US,"Shows rich, extracted flavors of blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam, milk chocolate, black currants, licorice and smoky cedar wood. The fruit is nice and ripe, but the wine is a little too soft and sweet. Drink now.",87,30.0,California,Lake County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Shannon Ridge
France,"This light-colored wine is attractively perfumed but with a grassy edge that suggests the fruit was underripe. Built for the short term, it will be ready from late 2017.",84,19.0,Burgundy,Bourgogne,Pinot Noir,Pierre Gruber
US,Aromas of bright pink roses and soft cherry fruit are a bit shy on the nose but pretty when they do arise. The palate of this 85% Syrah and 15% Viognier blend shows raspberry fruit and lime-rind tartness.,87,28.0,California,Paso Robles,Rosé,Four Lanterns
Italy,"Here is a smooth, supple sparkling wine, with bright aromas of citrus, stone fruit, apricot, baked bread and even a touch of piquant white peppercorn. The mouthfeel is full and generous, with fine, tonic perlage on the finish.",91,24.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,Sparkling Blend,La Montina
US,"From 100% estate-grown fruit, this 100% varietal wine is dusty and dark with elements of pencil shavings, cedar and cassis. With that herbal and earthy intensity giving it defined character, it remains medium bodied and textured on the palate, with a saltiness to the finish.",88,80.0,California,Atlas Peak,Cabernet Sauvignon,Lobo
Spain,"Given the high level at which Rioja is running these days, this green wine with aromas of pole beans and tobacco ash just isn't up to standards. Balance and elegance are nowhere to be found.",81,24.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo,Lar de Paula
US,"A bit lighter in color than other Rhône blends, certainly due to the 40% Counoise (and bolstered by 36% Mourvèdre and 24% Grenache), this offers a punchy red-currant, orange-rind and chaparral-scrub nose. Fresh cracked black pepper, cranberry-orange-plum juice and a rich earthy tone show on the palate.",90,40.0,California,Adelaida District,Rhône-style Red Blend,kukkula
US,"Very good price for a Riesling of this quality. It's very dry and high in acidity, cleansing the palate and stimulating it to appreciate rich fare, from liver paté on toast to grilled trout or chicken satay. Or delicious on its own, with fresh citrus, apricot and peach fruit flavors.",89,14.0,California,El Dorado County,Riesling,Jacella
US,"This offers appealing notes of cranberry, cherry and orange peel along with a kiss of vanilla. It's tart and fresh in style with puckering fruit flavors—perfect for the dinner table.",87,13.0,Washington,Washington,Blaufränkisch,Shooting Star
US,"A tough wine to like right now. It's tightly wound and hard in tannins and bone dry, which is the winery's house style. These are grapes that were picked early, before they shriveled. The flavors veer between blackberries and currants to anise and pepper. The gamble is in the cellar. Try after 2013.",88,45.0,California,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Smith-Madrone
Argentina,"With attractive melon and other tropical aromas, this is a Torrontés that rises above the masses. It smells great and tastes like a pure blend of lychee fruit, tangerine and honeydew melon. The palate feel is smooth and round, and the finish is dry, clean and healthy. It's everything that Torrontés should be. Drink now.",88,12.0,Other,Salta,Torrontés,Alamos
France,"In this dense wine, dusty tannins ride over spice and black currant fruits, giving weight and concentration while retaining the natural stylish character of the château.",94,24.0,Bordeaux,Pomerol,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Vieux Château Certan

US,"Soft and luscious, this Cabernet has a melted fruit quality, like cherry pie filling, with a scoop of vanilla and coffee ice cream. Tasty, but beyond that is great structure and bones. Drink this wine by 2015.",92,42.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Darioush
France,"Although 2006 won't go down as a great vintage in the northern Rhône, Chapoutier's selections parcellaires are still top notch. Le Méal gets the nod this year as the most powerful of the group, with massive espresso and black olive elements tinged with meat and underlain by a bed of ripe blueberries. Long and mouthwatering on the finish, look for this wine to approach maturity by 2016; drink well through 2025 or longer.",95,270.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,Syrah,M. Chapoutier
France,"It is sometimes forgotten that Chassagne-Montrachet also produces red wines. Louis Latour's wine presents a fine structure, soft and fresh acidity and ripe, jammy berry flavors. There is a good core of dryness that suggests aging for 2–3 years.",88,25.0,Burgundy,Chassagne-Montrachet,Pinot Noir,Louis Latour
US,"Black currants, cherries, chocolate, tobacco, coffee, cola and dusty Asian spices mark this dry, young Syrah. Turns a little rustic and thin on the finish, but the flavors are rich and interesting.",87,25.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Syrah,Roshambo
US,"There's a rich, velvety texture here, and it's fully dry, but the fruit has a baked quality, and the burnt char of oak adds to that smoky astringency. Finishes salty. Might simply be going through a clumsy stage.",84,45.0,California,Carneros,Syrah,San Sakana
US,"Good Cabernet, dry and complex, showing classic Napa character. The tannin structure is near perfect, while the flavors are ripe and juicy in blackberries, cherries, currants and cedar. Polished now and through 2013.",92,42.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Frog's Leap

US,"This is 100% Zinfandel, unlike the regular bottling, from specially selected barrels. 300 cases made. There's concentrated raspberry fruit in the nose, good intensity on the palate, with a good, rich mouthfeel and full, soft tannins in the finish.",89,25.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel,Château Souverain
US,"This very tannic wine is fierce and astringent at this time. It's almost old-fashioned in its puckery dryness. True, it has a deep core of ripe blackberry, cherry, currant, licorice and cola flavors that could emerge after sufficient aging, but it's not a certainty.",85,70.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Petroni
US,"The lusciousness factor on this wine is high. It's soft, dry and silky, with sensual flavors of red cherries, vanilla, cola, herbs and anise. Almost like a Pinot Noir, but a little bit more full-bodied. Drink now.",92,40.0,California,Mount Veeder,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Yates Family Vineyard
US,"Made in the modern, ripe California style of exceptionally ripe fruit, accented with strong oak. Not especially subtle, but flattering to the palate, with opulent flavors of pineapple crème brûlée, peaches, cream, buttered toast, vanilla bean and honeysuckle.",88,35.0,California,Anderson Valley,Chardonnay,Barnett
US,"Hard in tannins and bone dry, this Malbec needs rich beef dishes to balance out the astringency. It has a ripe heart of blackberries and currants, and is at its best now. Decant for a few hours.",86,28.0,California,Paso Robles,Malbec,Midnight
Italy,"This hearty Brunello shows a ripe, almost jammy personality with strawberry and raspberry preserve notes. There are background tones of exotic spice, vanilla and cinnamon that help support the wine's chewy fruit. The mouthfeel is soft and velvety.",88,24.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese Grosso,La Fiorita
US,"Deep and rich aromas of blackberry syrup and wet slate kick off this excellent, approachable representation of Santa Barbara County's new Ballard Canyon appellation. It's both juicy and tannic once sipped, tasty with blackberry and slight cherry juice. Balanced with medium-range force, it provides evidence of how the region evens out Syrah's rougher edges.",91,38.0,California,Ballard Canyon,Syrah,Transcendence
Argentina,"There's no drop-off in this wine from the excellent 2005. Expect blackberry, cassis and dry balsam wood/cedar aromas. The palate is lush and chewy, but also vital and lively. Toasty, dark berry flavors get a softening of vanilla on the finish. A winner to drink now through 2013.",92,55.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Bodega Catena Zapata
Italy,"This is a lovely Barolo with oak-driven aromas of vanilla and sweet spice between delicate layers of rose, tar and wild berry. There's plenty of tasty pulp and substance backed by tight tannins that will undoubtedly relax with more time in the bottle. Cellar age this wine five to ten more years.",93,80.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Ciabot Berton
US,"Red cherry, ripe cranberry, blackberry and a rocky minerality show on the nose of this once popular twist-top, bicycle-sporting wine that's back on the market. The palate is very fruit forward with very ripe blackberry and red cherry fruit, enough grip to catch attention and a cigar box complexity.",86,11.0,California,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cycles Gladiator
Australia,"A 60-40 blend, this full-bodied, creamy textured, lush wine captures the sun of McLaren Vale without taking it too far. Vanilla, licorice and plum notes mark the nose, while the plummy flavors pick up mocha shadings before turning a bit fudge-like on the long, velvety finish. Drink now–2018.",92,65.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,Shiraz-Grenache,Angove
Spain,"Forward and direct up front, this has a yeasty but fresh apple aroma. It feels clean and ready, with lemon-lime and kiwi flavors that lead to a fresh finish. This is textbook Cava with some sweetness.",85,12.0,Catalonia,Cava,Sparkling Blend,Freixenet
US,"Plump and spicy, mixing mint and apple, with flavors running into riper fruits—pear and peach. This fills the mouth with luscious fruit, suggestions of vanilla cream and butterscotch, with just enough acidity to bolster it on through into the finish. It's big and thick for Riesling, yet beautifully balanced and quite delicious.",90,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling,Southard
Argentina,"Both stewy and sweet on the nose. The palate is brawny and unctuous, with big berry fruit getting gobbled up by the wine's grabby, tannic structure. This is wild, rubbery, young Cab. Air it out and serve at your barbecue.",84,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Cabernet Sauvignon,Terrazas de Los Andes
US,"This is easily Cuvaison's best Pinot Noir ever. It's not only delicious right out of the bottle, it's an ager. Really flatters the palate with appealing cherry, black raspberry, cola and tangerine fruit, wrapped in a silky texture. Yet it shows a dense, tightly tannic quality that suggest up to 8 years in the cellar.",92,45.0,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,Cuvaison
France,"This is a rich wine that balances attractive white and yellow fruits with intense citrusy acidity. The result is a structured, round, tangy Chardonnay that is likely to smooth out further as it develops over the next 2–3 years.",88,24.0,Burgundy,Bourgogne,Chardonnay,André Guichot
US,"Peppery and stemmy, with a wintergreen tartness that suggests unevenly ripened grapes. The berry-cherry flavors are diluted. Still, it's a clean, dry wine at a decent price.",84,10.0,California,Lodi,Zinfandel,Campus Oaks

Italy,"This vintage has some Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot in the blend to back the Sangiovese and Merlot, and is more complex and complete.

It's a sophisticated wine with tight tannins and a long, dusty finish.",93,85.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Red Blend,Fattoria La Massa
US,"Inherit (as in the meek shall… etc.) is a very ripe, dark and somewhat pruney wine with massive dark accents. The blend smoothes it out and softens the animal notes. It's briary, with berry, plum, chocolate and earth flavors; ready to go!",89,25.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Red Blend,Meek Family

US,"This blend of 43% Grenache, 32% Petite Sirah and 25% Syrah shows dense berry aromas along with cherry muffins and violets on the nose.

Argentina,"Aromas of mocha, rubber, smoky leather and berry fruit indicate good things to come, but in the mouth this wine fails to deliver equal to its price and the previous successes of Trapiche's single-vineyard Malbec project. Scouring acidity is the main culprit; the wine seems clipped, tartaric and angular, thus it's all superficial and not deep or rich enough to rate better.",86,50.0,Mendoza Province,La Consulta,Malbec,Trapiche

Argentina,"There's no denying the fact that this smells stalky and burnt, with leathery fruit aromas. In the mouth, it's choppy, with scratchy acidity leading to a loud flavor profile with stalky berry, raisin and stewed flavors. Heat and additional roasted notes drive the finish on this Malbec.",85,29.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Alpamanta
US,"Fans of this variety will find something really interesting here. While the wine has the bigtime wild berry, chocolate, leather and spice flavors that Petite Sirah so dependably produces, it also boasts alcohol below 14%, giving it welcome balance. With thick, furry tannins, it's a guaranteed ager, if you like your Pets old.",91,22.0,California,El Dorado,Petite Sirah,Ursa

Spain,"The nose deals dill, coconut, vanilla and a lot of plum and berry. Soft but not really, with a lively but plush palate that starts with cranberry and raspberry and then deepens to show chocolate and spice. More of a middleweight, but one packing punch; would be nice with roast lamb, etc. Imported by Vintage Wines Inc.",89,35.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas Riojanas
Spain,"Disappointing considering the price. There's no good reason to pay $40 for a cava that's cidery and offers hints of vinegar along the way. That said, this is not a cheaply made disaster unworthy of a rating; still, it's austere and hints at sauerkraut.",80,40.0,Catalonia,Cava,Sparkling Blend,Maria Casanovas

Spain,"The excellent 2005 Azul is stout and secure, with a ripe, clean and modern bouquet that's backed up by a chewy, toasty flavor profile that pours on the black fruit and character.

US,"Young and forward, here's a seductive wine that's instantly attractive for its lush flavors and silky mouthfeel. Cherry pie filling, cola, pomegranate, rosehip tea, cocoa and coffee flavors mark this delicious Pinot, which finishes with crisp acids. It was made by Paul Hobbs.",92,42.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Stewart

US,"Aged partially in old oak barrels, there's a distinctly savory, spicy tone to pressed apple and pear aromas on this reserve Riesling.

Lifted floral tones lift the finish.",87,32.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Bellangelo

US,"At the age of four-plus years, this 100% Cabernet is not showing well. It's very tannic and dry, with mouthwatering acidity and a brittle mouthfeel. The flavors are elusive, suggesting black currants, oak and minerals, although it certainly is elegantly structured. It might improve by cellaring until 2022.",88,125.0,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon,Olabisi
France,"One of the classic wines from Drouhin, this concentrated and ripe wine has rich tannins, certainly laced with wood. Plum and red-fruit flavors are a delicious presence to go with the firm, solid structure. Age for 3–4 years.",90,34.0,Burgundy,Côte de Beaune,Pinot Noir,Joseph Drouhin
US,"Another success from Sebastiani. Dry and smooth, this has rich blackberry and oak flavors grounded in earthy tannins, and finishes dry and stylishly elegant. It could be your house Cab without breaking the bank.",87,18.0,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sebastiani
US,"A slick of wax and lanolin lends a mineral tone to bright apple cider and honey notes in this sprightly semisweet Riesling. Spine-tingling with acidity, it's an elegant, classically styled wine with a pristine, fruit-focused finish.",88,45.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Anthony Road

Australia,"Despite a challenging year in the Barossa, especially for Cabernet, this is a charming, medium-bodied wine that should drink well for the next 8 years or so. Aromas are slightly leafy and herbal, but also feature plenty of red currant fruit, while the tannins are well-ripened but still show typical Cab structure. Long on the finish.",92,24.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rockford
France,"With vines that are located next to La Tâche, this vineyard is great. Powerful and complex, this has the right depth of flavor. It is finely endowed with brooding tannins and black fruit flavors. The texture and acidity on the finish promise this has considerable aging potential.",94,24.0,Burgundy,Vosne-Romanée,Pinot Noir,Albert Bichot
US,"Full and focused, the nose of orange, crème brûlée and vanilla opens to a handsomely balanced palate of lively citrus, Granny Smith apple and vanilla cream flavors. Moderately plump and pleasing, good underlying acidity here keeps it elegant and maintains fine flavor definition. Butterscotch, lemon and spicy oak flavors mingle on the long finish.Top Value.",92,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay,Simi
Italy,"Despite good persistence and appealing earth and leather flavors, this Barbaresco fails to hit the mark. Aromas of paint thinner undermine the cherry fruit and flatten out the flavors in the mouth.",83,24.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Nebbiolo,Pier
US,"Acidity marks this fresh, young wine, giving a tension to the mouthfeel, and suggesting some time in the bottle to round it out.

The pedigree is obvious from the refined mouthfeel.",92,62.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir,Morgan

US,"There's some bitterness in this young Cab, enough to interfere with the blackberry and cherry-herb fruit. Tastes very dry, with puckery-astringent tannins. It's quite a good, rich wine, in a rustic way, and should age for some time, but lacks an essential richness.",87,49.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau Montelena
US,"Made in the Rosenblum manner, which is soft and gooey in chocolately fruit. In this case, the wine is vast in red cherry flavors, with sweet, smoky pie crust and vanilla. It's high in alcohol. Depending on how you look at it, it's either a vinous triumph or an eccentricity.",88,25.0,California,San Francisco Bay,Mourvèdre,Rosenblum
US,"Opens with a pure, clean, high-toned aroma, powerful yet delicate, of cherries, cola, coffee, cinnamon and smoky oak.

Simply a marvelous wine.",94,35.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Pinot Noir,Kendall-Jackson
Argentina,"Ripe, healthy and pure, with familiar aromas and flavors of cassis and berries. In the mouth, it's bright and lively, with plenty of acidity but no sheering, harsh qualities.

US,"100% Sémillon from Ste. Michelle's Canoe Ridge vineyard, this is a fine iteration of the grape, with firm flavors suggesting citrus, orange, muted stone fruits.

France,"A blend of 70% Pinot Noir and 30% Chardonnay, this is a true food Champagne. “Our objective was to show how powerful Pinot Noir can get in our wines,” says Charles Philipponnat, and he is right.

Imported by Ex-Cellars Wine Agencies, Inc.",93,63.0,Champagne,Champagne,Champagne Blend,Philipponnat

US,"It's tough to improve on Gordon Brothers' outstanding regular release of Chardonnay, a 90-point effort. All too often, the extra ripeness turns subtle nuances into thicker, less complex flavors. Barrel time adds butter and toast. So if you want a ripe, tropical, banana-and-peaches style of Chardonnay, with plenty of buttery oak, this will certainly do the trick. But somehow it seems less interesting than its cheaper sibling.",86,23.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay,Gordon Brothers

US,"This is a now you see it, now you don't Pinot. It's so young and acidic-tannic, it changes by the second in the glass, now brooding and shut, now ripely fruity in red currants and spicy mocha.

Not for long aging, but drinking well right now.",89,50.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Amalie Robert
US,"It would be easy to miss the complexity of this wine, as it comes out of the bottle tight and unyielding.

Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids.

France,"Château du Cros began life in the 12th century, commanding a superb military vantage point over the Garonne river. The surrounding vineyards have produced a fresh and fruity Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon blend with a mineral bite that gives a strong sense of structure.

A wonderful example of what Fiano di Avellino can be.",91,20.0,Southern Italy,Fiano di Avellino,White Blend,Terredora
Italy,"There's a grassy note of dried herb or hay at the back of white flower, citrus and stone fruit. Moletto's S Extra Dry is an easy-drinking Prosecco that would pair with finger foods or shrimp canapés.",86,24.0,Veneto,Prosecco,Glera,Moletto
Argentina,"Starts with bulky fruit and bacon aromas. The palate is sort of rattled and jagged in terms of feel, while the flavors of baked berry fruit slip toward herbal. All in all, it's a pleasant, jammy, friendly, easy-to-drink, generic Cabernet.",86,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cruz Alta
US,"This is a new brand from Gallo, named after a vineyard the Louis M. Martini winery used to designate. It's a rich, sturdy Merlot, with a thick tannin structure, and shows forward flavors of cherries, black and red currants, licorice, blackberry tea, cola and spice. Not an ager, but impressive for its complexity.",87,23.0,California,Napa-Sonoma,Merlot,Ghost Pines
France,"This wine is ripe and balanced, showing full red fruits alongside a core of dry tannins. Considerable acidity gives a refreshing lift. Wait some more to drink, at least until 2017.",86,24.0,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Maison Bouey
Argentina,"Scratchy on the nose, with raspberry and plum aromas. The palate has a generic, rubbery feel and sweet, standard cherry, cassis and plum flavors. Medicinal and rubbery on the finish, but will go well with basic foods like pizza, spaghetti or a burger.",86,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Cabernet Sauvignon,Alberti 154
US,"This ups the percentage of Cabernet to 60%, with 25% Syrah, 14% Petit Verdot and just 1% Cabernet Franc. Released almost a full year later than the other Long Shadows reds, it is well-integrated and focused, with high-toned black cherry fruit set in dusty tannins. Scents of sandalwood drift through, along with cocoa and spice. As good or even better than the outstanding 2006.",93,50.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend,Chester Kidder
Italy,"This Prosecco Brut (made with 5% Chardonnay for extra smoothness) delivers floral aromas of dried lavender and rose backed by mineral tones and pulpy peach. It's a lively and generous wine made by Franco Adami, one of the most charismatic and enthusiastic producers in Prosecco land.",87,18.0,Veneto,Prosecco di Valdobbiadene,Prosecco,Adami
Italy,"There's a very interesting and unique Asian quality here that reveals itself on the nose as saffron, soya, clove and Chinese barbecue sauce. The wine is lean and compact in the mouth with a long, silky finish: Hold five to 10 years in your cellar.",91,70.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Giacomo Ascheri
Italy,"This is a benchmark Prosecco Extra Dry with just enough natural sweetness in its fiber to enforce its pretty aromas of peach, apricot and grapefruit.

Australia,"Mouthfilling and supple, this is a top-notch example of Barossa Shiraz. Despite the soft tannins, the fruit is bright and lively, with tart red plum and raspberry notes at the core, surrounded by hints of vanilla and mint. Long and vibrant on the finish, this is drinkable already, but should age well through at least 2025.",93,122.0,South Australia,Barossa,Shiraz,Elderton
US,"Formerly the popular Three Vineyards bottling, this has been re-named, but remains the same friendly Merlot-dominated Bordeaux blend, with just a bit of Syrah adding spice.

This is nearly as good as the winery's more costly Walking Tree Vineyard Block Collection Cabernet, but it's just a little less concentrated.",89,13.0,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Geyser Peak
Italy,"Blackberry, sweet vanilla and candied fruit are backed by oak-related aromas of spice and tobacco: But, the real beauty of this wine is that those determined aromas are backed by a delicate fluttering of cola, licorice and eucalyptus. This is a long aging wine and the natural heft and thickness of its texture suggests that it has many years to go.",92,90.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Ciabot Berton
US,"One of the most successful Bordeaux blends to come out of Sonoma Valley lately, this wine is dry and earthy, providing a nice alternative to today's super-fruity, overripe style.

Really stylish for drinking now.",91,20.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Highway 12

Spain,"There's no shortage of power here. Forward berry aromas mixed with earth and leather ring true, while the palate is layered, broad, chewy and offers bright cherry and plum flavors.

US,"Lots of razzle-dazzle in this rich, opulent Chardonnay. Shows buttery, oak-inspired pear and pineapple flavors, with a leesy, creamy mouthfeel, and fine acidity to brighten and balance all that richness. Drink this decadent wine with lobster, scallops, crab or shrimp, or a great ahi tuna tartare with potato chips.",93,40.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay,Bernardus
US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir. Plays in the major leagues, with its refined texture and complex flavors of cherries, raspberries, licorice and sandalwood, with a long, spicy finish.

US,"A little raw in acidity, with some green olive notes, but the rustic nature works in favor of the wine, grounding its rich blackberry, currant and chocolate flavors with earthiness. Tasted in a flight of much more expensive wines, this Cab did very well.",87,12.0,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,Morro Bay
US,"What a beautiful Pinot Noir for drinking now with lamb chops or maybe a rich, exotic Ahi tuna tartare. Brilliantly crisp in acidity, with a clean, bracing mouthfeel, it offers dazzlingly rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, orange zest, Dr. Pepper cola and Asian spices, with smoky oak adding elaborate tiers of vanilla char. For the price, it's a very great buy.",95,37.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir,Fort Ross

US,"What a nice wine this is, fruity and wonderfully bright and crisp in citrus acidity. It doesn't taste very oaky, despite barrel fermentation, and that allows those pure Monterey peach, lime, apricot and papaya flavors to shine.",91,18.0,California,Monterey,Chardonnay,San Saba
Argentina,"This is an easy type of wine made from Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. It opens with simple, familiar aromas of jammy berry and milk chocolate, followed by a creamy-textured palate, with thickness and oaky flavors of hickory, raspberry jam and vanilla. Beyond that, it doesn't offer much complexity or nuance.",85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Red Blend,Casarena

Spain,"A bready, yeasty nose announces that this brut nature is more than ready to drink. In the mouth, it's smooth, but light on verve and bubbles. Oxidized flavors of spent yeast, bread dough and sautéed mushroom finish dry and reserved, but somewhat flat. Drink now.",90,100.0,Catalonia,Cava,Sparkling Blend,Agustí Torelló Mata
US,"Barrel fermented and aged on the lees for almost a year, this is a nutty, slightly oily wine that shows the influence of the barrel, but lacks the fruit density to match it. The 14% alcohol hits the palate with some heat. High-toned and a bit harsh.",85,18.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,David Hill
Italy,"Here's a lovely expression of Barbera from Asti, Piedmont, with a pretty balance of chocolate, cherry and blackberry aromas. Smoky oak-related elements appear in the background as do drying mineral notes. With some 29,000 cases made, this wine should not be difficult to locate and the low price is hard to beat.",89,16.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,Barbera,Terre da Vino
US,"This is the second label of Boedecker Cellars; 100% Pinot Noir from a mix of vineyards including Maresh and Momtazi. It's a thin, tart and herbal wine. Flavors are green and leafy, and the tannins take over with astringent tea flavors.",85,18.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Pappas Wine Company
US,"The operative word here is “big.” It's intense and powerful in orange, peach and banana flavors, and its notes of caramelized oak and vanilla are equally strong. Whether you like this oversized profile is a matter of taste, but this Chardonnay earns its score for sheer power and complexity.",90,38.0,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay,La Follette
US,"Sugary and oaky, a simple wine that doesn't do much to promote Livermore Valley. Tastes like sweetened pineapple and pear juice.",81,21.0,California,Livermore Valley,Chardonnay,Longevity
US,"Dark burgundy in color, it's crafted from estate-grown, organically certified grapes, a mix of Swan, Dijon 667 and 777 and Pommard clones. It has a dense, toasty character from 16 months in French oak, almost half of it new. A darker profile of baked plum and cinnamon swirls amid leathery earth. The finish is zingy and the wine is labeled as vegan.",90,75.0,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,Domaine Carneros

US,"Iron Horse crafted this brut, which has a gorgeous red and yellow label, for the Chinese market. It's similar to their other bruts, dry and rich in lime, strawberry and yeasty flavors, although it's softer, which may reflect what Iron Horse knows about the Chinese palate. The price also seems to reflect what Iron Horse believes the Chinese market will bear.",87,98.0,California,Green Valley,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse
US,"A tremendous Cabernet, pure and refined, and undoubtedly the beneficiary of its great vintage. It's dry and elegant, with the slightly herbal tinge and soft tannins that Alexander Valley invariably lends. Yet the flavor profile is dominated by delicious, oak-inspired blackberries, cherries and currants. Brilliant and beautiful, and should develop for many years.",95,70.0,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt

US,"Marked by a lean minerality, this Chablis-style wine is not one of those fat, opulent Chards that dazzles with sheer richness. It's more subtle than that, and more acidic. Structure, in fact, is the name of the game here, with its lemon and lime flavors that barely break into green apples. Fine now, if not served too cold, and for the next 2–4 years. Beyond that, wines of this kind go quickly downhill.",92,65.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay,Morgan
US,"Is that a touch of botrytis on the nose? Or does that apricot come from the Rued clone of Chardonnay? Either way, this dry wine offers vastly complex layers of fruits, spices, minerals, white flowers and smoky new oak. It's exotic, a Chardonnay that marches to a different beat and demands some understanding on the part of the taster.",92,35.0,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate

Spain,"Austere, green aromas are about as much as one can pull from the nose, while the palate is fresh and acidic, but lean. Flavors of lime, citrus and pith are zesty at first but pithy later on.

US,"It's hard to choose a favorite amidst Wiemer's 2012 lineup, but this one is a strong contender. It's brisk, yet intensely penetrating on the nose and palate, with a luscious, juicy palate full of sweet white peach and mango flavors. Zesty lemon-lime acidity and a crush of minerals linger on the finish. It's a complex yet effortlessly enjoyable medium-sweet Riesling to savor now, or through 2021–2024.",92,45.0,New York,Seneca Lake,Riesling,Hermann J. Wiemer

Italy,"Aromas of tarmac, burned rubber and oak open this 70-30 blend of Montepulciano and Sangiovese.

US,"There's a wild quality to the fruit, as if the blackberries and cherries were picked in some sunny hollow in a eucalyptus forest. The wine is streamlined and intense, with focused, chiseled tannins. Showing superb balance and an unerring sense of control, it should develop in the bottle over the next 8–10 years.",93,60.0,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon,Gamble Family Vineyards

Argentina,"Chunky, ripe and fruity, with bacon and roasted berry aromas.

The presentation is correct but lacks specific definition although the wine is bright, polished and more focused in the mouth.",89,26.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Nebbiolo,Cascina Luisin
Italy,"This is a distinctively linear and sharp Barbera d'Asti with a strong mineral vein that runs straight through the middle. You'll sense those mineral, granite notes on the bouquet and the mouthfeel is especially dry and polished.",89,17.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,Barbera,Cantina Vignasone

Nothing quite like it anywhere, with its inky dark color, big, thick tannins and ripe, exuberant flavors of berries, currants, mocha, leather, tobacco, cedar and peppery spices. What's especially nice about this bottling is the dryness and moderate alcohol. A superior wine that should age for the better part of a decade.",93,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Petite Sirah,Summers
France,"This is a luxurious wine that's opulently rich. Ripe black fruits dominate, lending fullness to the firm structure in the backdrop. It's a wine with great potential, density and weight. Touches of chocolate and licorice combine with flavors of dark plum, toast and spice. Drink from 2018.",94,24.0,Bordeaux,Pauillac,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lynch-Bages
US,"Here's a gutsy, fruity Cabernet. It fills the mouth with juicy raspberry, cherry and blackberry flavors and hints of chocolate. Nothing subtle, just a dry, rich red wine for drinking now.",86,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hess
France,"The toast character lends a firm structure to this solid, rich wine. A spice note pairs well with the white plum and apricot fruit, and there is a sense that this needs to age for several years in order to bring out its richness and full potential.",91,30.0,Burgundy,Mercurey,Chardonnay,Domaine Faiveley
Italy,"Dark and chunky, both in sight and smell. Nevertheless, it's fairly nice on the palate, but it's soft. The black plum, cherry and licorice flavors are warm although not overly precise. Finishes with a decent kick as well as balancing flavors of fresh tomato and cherry. Imported by Opici Import Company.",88,60.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese,La Gerla
Italy,"This is a very impressive Riserva that shows personality and longevity. Tar, asphalt and licorice notes are enhanced by delicate tones of balsam, cola and candied orange peel. In the mouth, this Barolo is a real charmer: the fullness and long persistency will win you over. Drink after 2015.",93,69.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Bel Colle
France,"With its sandstone soil, the Abbaye de Morgeot vineyard is equally suited to Pinot Noir as to Chardonnay. But it is able to produce fresh, fruity wines, like this one. A spice and citric blend dances on the palate.",91,64.0,Burgundy,Chassagne-Montrachet,Chardonnay,Louis Jadot

US,"Made in a very ripe, extracted style, this eccentric wine has flavors of apricots, or more precisely, apricot marmalade on buttered toast, because it's also oaky. It's dry and crisp in acids. A bit unusual, but in its own way, a good wine.",86,20.0,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay,River Road
US,"This is delicious, concentrated and showing a range of nuances; along with ripe apple and pear flavors come spicy hints of cinnamon and baking spices. Firm acids, good balance, and more texture and length than most domestic Chardonnays in this price range.",90,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Chardonnay,Dusted Valley
US,"Plump and soft, with flavors that closely echo those found in the Quail Hill Vineyard bottling: spice, beet, earth, cola and cherries. Not as big as the Quail Hill, and not as long on the finish, but an attractive, easy-to-drink Pinot for near-term consumption.",88,32.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Lynmar
France,"Made using an adaptation of a Cahors tradition of warming the must before fermentation to increase stability as well as color. Immensely powerful tannins, chocolate density, with a youthful bitter edge at this stage.",93,60.0,Southwest France,Cahors,Malbec,Jean-Luc Baldès
US,"Made like an old-fashioned Barbera, this one is truculent in tannins, with a full-bodied mouthfeel housing flavors of blackberries, currants, leather, anise and pepper. It will probably live for two decades, gradually sweetening as it throws sediment, but always remaining rustic.",87,42.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Barbera,Viansa
US,"This is one of the ripest Laurel Glens in years, and it's sumptuous now. With gigantic cherry, blackberry, black raspberry, cassis, root beer and cinnamon-anise flavors wrapped into a softly tannic texture. Seems at its best now and for four or five more years.",89,55.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon,Laurel Glen
US,"Juicy cranberry and pie cherry fruit brings this wine into clear focus. There is an underpinning of wet cement that comes across in the mid-palate, a sort of a stone wall that the fruit can't quite overcome. It fades into an astringent, tannic finish, still buoyed by those juicy acids.",87,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Snoqualmie
Italy,"This is a limited-edition Bardolino Superiore Classico that shows impressive intensity and a darker, richer consistency. The wine is sweet and chewy with good succulence, loads of cherry flavors, and long persistency on the powerful finish.

US,"Intensely aromatic, with loads of sunny peach, apricot and yellow flower aromas, this off-dry Riesling is ripe and concentrated, yet impeccably structured. So fruity, it's almost tropical on the palate, but it finishes dry and crisp, with penetrating lemon-lime acidity.",89,16.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Sheldrake Point
France,"Dry, firmly tannic wine, dominated by mint and coffee flavors along with wood. The fruit underneath has a suggestion of ripe blackberry flavors but will need at least 3 years to come out. It is a powerful, complex wine for aging.",90,25.0,Southwest France,Cahors,Malbec,Château du Port
US,"Big and lush, this one's got gobs of chocolate, plum, spice, black cherry, spice, coffee, herb, toast, and vanilla, all framed in creamy smooth tannins that give a supple quality to the blend. Long, lush and smooth at the end.",90,42.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Zinfandel,Rosenblum
US,"With a pale straw color, this brut is properly dry and crisp, although it does have a honey-sweet richness. It shows citrus and pear flavors, with the yeasty, doughy earthiness of a good sparkling wine. A little scoury and fairly priced, it's a fine bubbly to drink now.",87,13.0,California,California,Sparkling Blend,Korbel

US,"With racy acidity, this palate-cleansing Chard shows a firm minerality undergirding Key lime pie filling and oaky, vanilla flavors. Fully dry, it's a good food Chard. Try with a creamy mushroom risotto.",88,24.0,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay,Domaine Alfred
Spain,"Blackberry, cassis, coffee and charred aromas make for a smoky, healthy, attractive bouquet. This is dense, deep, tannic and a bit rubbery and bouncy in feel. Tea, herb, chocolate and baked blackberry flavors end with cocoa and herbal, earthy notes. Drink this ripe gran reserva through 2023.",92,70.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
Australia,"For the second consecutive vintage, this wine comes close to mimicking those elusive floral and spice elements of the northern Rhône. The flavors combine apricot and blueberry fruit with licorice, black olive, coffee and cracked pepper. A medium-bodied Shiraz for near-term consumption, but loaded with complexity. Drink now–2012.",90,25.0,Victoria,Victoria,Shiraz-Viognier,Domaine Terlato & Chapoutier
US,"It's unbelievable that this Chardonnay is unoaked, it's so incredibly rich and creamy. Just packed with layers of tropical fruits, peaches, Asian pears and oatmeal cookies. All that butter and cream must be from the malolactic fermentation and aging on the lees. One of the best unoaked Chardonnays ever.",93,29.0,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
US,"An interesting Merlot characterized not only by complexity, but by structure. The cherry, cassis, mocha and cedary spice flavors are entirely dry, and balanced with a brisk architecture of acidity and tannins. This is an elegant table wine that will let the food star rather than drawing attention to itself.",90,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Merlot,Ahnfeldt
Argentina,"Juicy and jumpy on the nose, but not sour. The palate of this dark, almost red Malbec rosé is sweet and candied but also zesty due to pretty lively acids. It's not a stellar wine but it is full of berries and spunk.",84,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Chakana
US,"Crisp and tight aromas of mandarin orange and lemonade meet with the intriguing nuance of foamed egg whites on the nose of this refreshing bottling. The mouthfeel is incredibly lively, showing flavors of lemon and lime juice, with a slight petrol touch to the palate.",92,18.0,California,Arroyo Seco,Riesling,Scratch

US,"There's something old-fashioned but richly satisfying about this Pinot Noir. It's a bit heavy and quite ripe, with flavors of cherry preserves, black raspberry marmalade, cola, sweet heirloom tomatoes and new oak, wrapped into a sturdy mouthfeel. A bit soft, and ready now with a grilled steak.",88,45.0,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,Robert Stemmler
US,"There are tons of rich, ripe flavors in this soft, high-alcohol California rendition of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Based on Mourvèdre and Grenache, it offers a blast of sweet cherry jam, blackberry, creamy mocha and spice.",88,36.0,California,Paso Robles,Rhône-style Red Blend,Adelaida

Italy,"Plush and softly textured, this modern expression of Brunello boasts generous tones of black fruit, cherry, tobacco, leather and cola with smooth, silky tannins. You could age this wine many more years, or drink it sooner thanks to the inherent softness here.",93,55.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese Grosso,Castiglion del Bosco

US,"Shows the brilliantly clean, racy acidity of Monterey that provides backbone and firmness to the citrus, peach, wildflower and mineral flavors. With a hint of diesel, it's a lovely California Riesling at a great price.",88,12.0,California,Monterey County,Riesling,Castle Rock
Australia,"On the subtle side for a Sauvignon Blanc, the Groom 2009 offers up exotic kiwi and guava scents before settling in to a more serious palate of lemon and pear. Its crisp and well-balanced, with a lovely final note of grapefruit peel. Drink now.",87,18.0,South Australia,Adelaide,Sauvignon Blanc,Groom
France,"This is an elegant, rich and round Volnay, with a red plum flavor and juicy acidity. With its fruitiness, this is already drinkable, although the tannic core does promise medium-term aging.",90,65.0,Burgundy,Volnay,Pinot Noir,Olivier Leflaive
US,"A good but rather rustic Cab. Shows fruity flavors of blackberries, black cherries, anise and smoky oak, with a spicy finish. The drawback is the tannic structure, which is jaggedly harsh. Drink now.",86,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Senders
Spain,"Dark and smoky, almost like a burnt wooden match on top of plum purée. Runs a bit tart in the mouth for Syrah, with red raspberry and cherry flavors. Firm and lean in the mouth.",83,30.0,Catalonia,Penedès,Syrah,Vallformosa
US,"Fruity and crisp, with fresh apple, lime and fig flavors that are balanced with brisk acids. An easy sipper that finishes slightly sweet.",85,16.0,California,Clear Lake,Pinot Grigio,Brassfield

US,"This is just coming into its own. It's still pretty tight and astringent in tannins, but has a major league core of cherry and blackberry fruit, and feels elegant and complex. As balanced as it is, it should continue to develop for six to eight more years.",92,40.0,California,Yountville,Cabernet Sauvignon,La Jota Vineyard

US,"If you choose one wine to stick in the cellar from the '03 vintage, make it this one. It's so dry, balanced and complex, yet so tannicly tough now, that it demands a good 6 years, at a minimum. The heart of blackberries and red currants is opulently rich, with overtones of cedar, pencil lead, red licorice and sweet dried herbs. Brings to mind a classic Rutherford Cab. As delicious as the wine is now, especially with decanting, it really will benefit from aging.",95,98.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Corison
US,"Dark plum, cracked clove, tart berry and a bit of rockiness kick off this wine from tour operator-turned-winemaker Art Sevtap. Tart and tannic, flavors range from cranberry to raspberry. The wine would go well alongside pasta with red sauce or chicken enchiladas.",88,42.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Sangiovese,Sevtap
France,"The Cave of Tain l'Hermitage is, through its cooperative members, the biggest owner in Hermitage. It certainly is able to produce a dense, dusty tannic wine, which has fine black fruits. The wine is rich, and dark, with acidity. It seems to be developing fast, and should last over the next 5-10 years.",88,35.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,Syrah,Cave de Tain

US,"Concannon has struggled to get Syrah right for many years, and this is actually their best release in a while. It's a dry, full-bodied, robust wine, rich in tannins and fruit, with some potential for development. The blackberry, coffee and spice flavors will play well against a nice steak.",89,24.0,California,Livermore Valley,Syrah,Concannon

Spain,"Flowery and fresh, with a bit of talc and creaminess to the bouquet. A little soft in the mouth, but still wet and likable.

US,"14.2%. Pretty. Char-toast, allspice, 5 spice, cola, tea, cocoa, dried cherry skin, pepper. In the mouth, a blast of sweet oak and cherry, but very dry. Rich, full-bodied, dry, sour cherry. Intricate. Fairly tannic. Sweet, cocoa-ey finish. Now - 2010.",93,24.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Rochioli

US,"Fabulous Pinot, about as good as Carneros gets. Sourced from this famous vineyard, it's silky and complex in cherries, sassafras, cola, black raspberry tea, vanilla and cinnamon spices that change and intensify as they roll across the palate. For all that, the finish is dry and balanced in crisp acidity. With just 70 cases produced, it's worth a special search.",94,50.0,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,Signorello
Italy,"Here's a wine that opens beautifully to all your senses. It boasts a dense, vibrant ruby color and delivers bright aromas of cherry, blackberry and bitter cranberry. In the mouth, however, this wine is softer and plusher than you'd expect. Sure, that trademark Barbera acidity is present, but its natural sharpness has been dulled.",90,90.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,Barbera,Coppo
France,"Las Vals is a 600-case bottling of 100% Mourvèdre. It shows plenty of the variety's dark, brooding character, with flavors of chocolate, plum and cola rounded out by a dash of tree bark.

Argentina,"Generic berry aromas with a hint of tomato and bramble set this off as a different breed, which it is, considering it's 78% Tannat.

Has its positives and negatives.",85,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Red Blend,Alma de los Andes
Italy,"There are only a few pockets of vineyard land in Italy with the correct levels of fog or moisture for noble rot (botrytis) and the Marche is one of them. But 2003 was a sweltering hot year and as a result this Sauvignon-based dessert wine lacks its characteristic intensity. You do get apricot, peach and honey over the wine's lean consistency and there's a slightly sour taste on the finish.",86,30.0,Central Italy,Marche,Sauvignon Blanc,Umani Ronchi

US,"Thick, oaky and loaded with toasty highlights, this substantial Syrah slathers its fruit in a heavy coat of caramel, buttered nuts and spice.

With substantial breathing time, boysenberry fruit melds with streaks of roasted coffee, clove and tobacco.",92,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah,Dunham
US,"Very, very tannic. Sometimes these super-astringent young Napa Cabs age well, but in this case you have to wonder if the fruit will outlast the tannins. Buried deep down are bone-dry, but savory, blackberries and black currants. It's a big gamble to cellar.",87,50.0,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon,Round Pond

US,"This has been a hit-and-miss wine over the years, and this is one of the misses. It's a dry, fairly tannic wine, with a forward acidity that needs fruit to balance it, but fruit is what the wine lacks. It just isn't rich enough and isn't likely to age well.",83,36.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Burgess

It has the appetizing bite and firm texture that will make it mouthwatering at dinner.,91,29.0,California,Mendocino County,Zinfandel,Lula
US,"Very little of this bottling was made. It's an experiment in making a white wine the way one would a red, fermented with skins and seeds, then aged eight months in new French oak. It's not for everyone. Cloudy and funky, it's teeming with acidity and yet somewhat dense on the palate, the fruit muted in favor of a taste of flowers and clay.",86,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell

US,"Marvelously fragrant, with seductive scents of cherries, rocks and chocolate, which, along with the astonishing color saturation, suggest a wine of immense power.

Italy,"This cloudy, amber-colored wine isn't for the faint of heart. Made from ancient Grecanico, Carricante and Catarratto vines on the slopes of Mt.

US,"Toast aromas accent ripe pears and golden-delicious apples in this soft, easy-to-like Chard that only lacks a bit of depth. A slightly bitter note on the finish should become less noticeable over the next few months.",83,10.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Chardonnay,Martha Clara

France,"Structured, concentrated and minerally, this wine's tannins are strong, and they accompany the juicy red-berry flavors. It has a dry core and a dense texture, and it's meant to age for at least six years.",94,92.0,Burgundy,Beaune,Pinot Noir,Domaine de Bellene
US,"Pretty in pink and orange hues, this stainless-steel-fermented charmer has a candied orange flavor that's delicious, followed by fresh, crisp strawberry and tangerine-laced acidity. Medium bodied, it ends with a burst of peach.",88,25.0,California,Sonoma County,Pinot Noir,Rodney Strong
France,"This lovely tete de cuvée shows off a mature, sweet bready nose with light citrus accents. It hits the palate with assertive, full green apple, bright citrus fruit complemented by strong leesy notes. Quite young and lively despite its age, it closes long with complex lemon and yeast flavors, and should even improve with a few more years in the bottle.",89,80.0,Champagne,Champagne,Champagne Blend,J. de Telmont
France,"The vines from this vineyard help to create big, concentrated wines that are tannic and dense. It is dark and firm, and the damson skin flavor adds to the sense of power. Age this for 6–8 years.",93,24.0,Burgundy,Morey-Saint-Denis,Pinot Noir,Domaine Bruno Clair

Spain,"This small-production (200 cases), barrel-aged Xarel-lo is well made but fails to strike a chord. It's yellow in color, with oily aromas of petrol, orange peel and wood resin. It feels sticky despite its supporting acids, and it tastes primarily of wood and white pepper, with a lasting bitterness.",84,30.0,Catalonia,Penedès,Xarel-lo,Marqués de Gelida
Spain,"Slightly more leafy, herbal and burnt on the nose than ideal, but there's also tobacco, cherry and earth notes to keep it proper. The palate is smooth in feel, with good depth, while the flavor profile has a salty side as well as black cherry and molasses. Good wine with a few issues.",87,24.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Tempranillo,Pago del Vostal

US,"Right out of the bottle, this wine smells and tastes tight and unappealing. It's marked by drying tannins and earthiness, giving it a rustic quality. Still, there's a good core of cherry fruit.",86,60.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Noir,Babcock
France,"Grapefruit and other citrus fruits come through the rich fruit. There is power and crispness here, along with a sense of structure from the mineral, flinty character that underlies the fruit. Hold for for 3–4 years.",92,32.0,Burgundy,Chablis,Chardonnay,Simonnet-Febvre
US,"Shows all the hallmarks of a fine young Petite Sirah. Dry and full-bodied, it's a tannic, acidic wine in its youth, packed with muscular black currant, coffee, caramel and spicy chocolate flavors. Fans of the variety will love its typicity, and if you're into aging your wines, this should develop for at least 10 years.",88,29.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Petite Sirah,Naggiar
Italy,"Made from native grape Caprettone, this savory wine beckons with inviting fragrances of white flowers, nuts, yellow apple, citrus and flint. The focused palate delivers nectarine, lemon zest, pear, mint and mineral accented with Mediterranean herbs. Crisp acidity gives a refreshing finish. Vinity Wine, Panebianco.",92,19.0,Southern Italy,Vesuvio,Caprettone,Cantine Olivella
Italy,"Here is a very nicely balanced Barbaresco with sweet spice notes and plump fruit tones of wild berry, cherry and blackberry. What the wine offers in harmony, it lacks in overt intensity: it shows flat, broad character in the mouth with wet earth and mineral tones on the finish.",88,24.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Nebbiolo,Grasso Fratelli
Argentina,"Aromas of brick dust, sweet spice, rubber and leather are good if you're not seeking saturated berry fruit, while the palate is starchy and grabby, with flavors of stewed berry, tomato, leather and earth. Raspberry is detectable on the thin finish, but so is a soupy flavor. Decent wine with some faults.",84,20.0,Other,Río Negro Valley,Merlot,Verum
Italy,"Sasyr is a new product from Rocca della Macìe. It's a blend of Sangiovese and Syrah with great fruit intensity and spice carried forward by the wine's natural succulence and intensity. Its top selling point, however, is its easy drinkability and broad food-pairing potential.",88,17.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Red Blend,Rocca delle Macìe

US,"As always, the Otis vineyard carries defining scents of pepper, sage, earth and stem; the fruit is restrained and also quite herbal. And yet the wine has old vine character, and ages beautifully, more like a Bordeaux than anything from this country. It's a fine bottle to tuck away into the cellar. Right now, the grapey, slightly plummy fruit and dried herbs are not entirely integrated.",88,25.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Columbia Winery
Spain,"With red wines joven usually means a few months in oak. It seems as though this wine was made the same way; there's a kiss of popcorn and buttered toast to the lemon and melon nose, while the palate has life, texture and complexity. Flavorwise, you should enjoy the wine's papaya, green banana and other tempered tropical flavors. Balanced and pleasing, and proof that certain Spanish whites can take some oaking.",90,23.0,Northern Spain,Valdeorras,Godello,Guitián

Argentina,"Floral aromas and berry power up front, then lead to a fresh, bright, almost screechy feeling palate. Toasty berry fruit flavors are moderately spicy and the finish offers a reprise of toastiness and kick. This wine contains 15% Malbec and Bonarda, which makes it more fruity.",87,12.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Finca El Origen
US,"This new Uriah marks a return to form; big, brawny, chewy and complex, yet generous and complete. The blend continues as before—54% Merlot, 33% Cab Franc, 7% Petit Verdot, and 6% Malbec, all estate-grown. The wine opens with barrel scents and flavors of tea, tobacco and wood smoke. The cherry-flavored fruit saturates the tobacco notes, gaining mass and turning into cherry cobbler as it does.",93,50.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Red Blend,Spring Valley Vineyard
US,"Far simpler, less ripe and altogether less pleasing than Forth's '02 Cab, also just released, this is an earthy, thin wine. Alcohol is the main feature.",82,18.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Forth
US,"An unusual blend of Riesling, Huxelrebe, Viognier and Sauvignon Blanc, this has residual sugar of almost 3%, but marries the sweetness to a Vouvray-like tartness. Your tongue dances back and forth from honey to tea, from sweet to dry. Excellent length and a wash of fresh cut orange as it fades.",88,24.0,Oregon,Oregon,White Blend,Madrone Mountain

US,"In its youth, this Bordeaux blend is dry and a little harsh, with a green, minty edge to the cherry fruit and oak. The acidity accentuates the tannins, which give the wine a hard finish. Not going anywhere, so drink now.",83,20.0,California,Central Coast,Meritage,Hahn
US,"A bit one-dimensional, with jammy red cherry pie filling flavors that taste sweet and glyceriney. Tasty, but cloys after a few sips. Ready now.",84,38.0,California,Paso Robles,Grenache,Terry Hoage
US,"A flashy wine. Shows sweet caramelized, buttered toast and vanilla custard notes from the oak, but the underlying fruit flavors, of golden mangoes and ripe pears, are strong enough to support the barrel influences.",90,35.0,California,Carneros,Chardonnay,Roche
France,"An herbaceous, catty wine, packed with gooseberry and grapefruit flavors. It is all crisp, fresh fruit and tight texture. It needs a few months to lose its shocking acidity.",84,24.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Blanc,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Petite Sirène

US,"Good, solid fruit flavors fill out this light-colored but full-bodied Grenache. It has ripe plum, tart cherry and cedar nuances; a broad, firm texture helps flavors linger on the finish. It's the kind of wine that tastes better with each sip.",88,28.0,California,Calaveras County,Grenache,Calavera
Spain,"Concentrated and sweet, with a baked, raisiny richness that maintains its clarity. The palate is dense but not punishing or tannic. Flavors of blackberry and prune veer toward syrupy, setting up a sweet, generous finish of fig paste and coconut. Modern-styled Rioja done right.",91,55.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo,Abel Mendoza
France,"Full, rounded wine, with herbs, some green tobacco and spice flavors. This is fresh, but full, well balanced and with a creamy apple aftertaste.",87,14.0,Loire Valley,Vouvray,Chenin Blanc,Alliance Loire
Australia,"A solid example of cool-climate Australian Cabernet, Yering Station's 2005 boasts slightly lifted aromas of dried spices and wintergreen, easing into cassis and mint on the palate. It's a bit austere and firm right now, worth holding 2–3 years. To drink now, pair with rare beef or lamb.",88,18.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Yering Station
US,"The winery's most expensive wine comes from very low-yielding Martini selection grapes planted in 1975. The '07, tasted at a bit more than one year of age, was pronounced in smoky oak and robust tannins, showing jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, blueberries, anise, cloves and cedar. Hold this powerful wine until 2011.",95,85.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Hartford Court

France,"A wonderfully firm, concentrated wine that walks a fine, balanced line between richness and poised structure. It is classic in the best sense, showing all the shape of a fine Bordeaux, while adding the extra dimension of the freshest of black fruits, complexity from a few hints of wood, and a dark, brooding, long-lasting aftertaste.",96,90.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Julien,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Léoville Barton
Argentina,"Burnt rubber, roasted generic berry and rooty tobacco aromas define the nose, which sets up a tangy, sharp, angular palate that shows little more than tart, quick cherry and raspberry flavors. Short and light on the finish.",83,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Merlot,Vila
US,"Rich in black cherries, cassis, mocha, smoky oak and black pepper, but there's a sharp, tannic sting throughout that doesn't seem likely to age away before the fruit fades. Drink now with BBQ.",86,45.0,California,Paso Robles,Grenache,Kaleidos
Italy,"Cherry and vanilla are this ripasso's most prominent aromas but if you dig deep you will uncover Spanish cedar, blueberry tart, maple syrup and Indian spice.

Imported by Wine Emporium.",90,38.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,Chardonnay,Monte Rossa
US,"Bright and spicy and loaded with great, clean, pure fruit flavors. This is exemplary for the '06 vintage; a wine of lovely purity and focus.

Definitely the biggest and most complete Two Blondes bottling to date.",91,45.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Red Blend,Andrew Will

Australia,"With 75% Shiraz, 22% Cabernet Franc and 3% Viognier, this wine stands out in a crowd. We get your expected plum and pepper notes from the Shiraz, but there are also elegant notes of cherry juice, pipe tobacco and tomato leaf along with a surprisingly firm acidity given the high level of ripeness. Tame tannins and leather notes come through on the finish. Drink now to 2013.",88,20.0,South Australia,Barossa,Red Blend,Creed of Barossa

Argentina,"Since coming onto the scene with the 2002 vintage, this Chilean-run venture (Montes S.A.) has hit the right notes time after time.

Spain,"An older wine with more oak than jazzy fruit, so the aromas are heavy with the scent of cinnamon and the palate is more drying and spicy than it is rich and rewarding.

US,"Acidity marks this fresh, young Pinot Noir. It's as if the raspberry and cherry wine has been enlivened with a splash or three of lime juice.

Italy,"This medium weight wine shows complex dark plum, toast, tar and cocoa notes, but there is also a decidedly sauvage element, and this gamy note won't appeal to all tasters. Dense black-cherry, plum and licorice flavors, brisk acidity and full, ripe tannins round out the package. Has impressive qualities, but also controversial ones. Cellar until 2005.",87,38.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,Sangiovese,Antinori

The acids, tannins and new oak show now, and also the intensely ripe cherry fruit, with all the parts jockeying for position. Needs time to knit together. Best after 2007, and through 2011 before it loses fruit.",90,60.0,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,Acacia
US,"A bone-dry, slightly green Sauvignon Blanc, with lemongrass and gooseberry flavors, boosted with vibrant acidity. Feels elegant and sleek, but won't appeal to everyone. The grapes for this unoaked wine came from Sonoma and Lake counties.",86,30.0,California,California,Sauvignon Blanc,Capture
France,"The name comes from the fact that this vineyard was once a truffle bed, high up the slope of Puligny-Montrachet. The wine shows wood, attractive fruitiness and layers of spice and almonds. It is rounded, the soft texture balanced by acidity. Drink from 2016.",93,85.0,Burgundy,Puligny-Montrachet,Chardonnay,Louis Latour
US,"This is the winery's Merlot-driven second wine, generally composed of barrels not used in the flagship Chaleur Estate. In this vintage it comes out a bit on the funky side, with scents that might be interpreted as reminiscent of truffles, leather and earth. Cedar, lead pencil and black fruits suggest its pedigreed sibling. Very tannic, earthy and substantial compared with previous vintages of D2.",89,36.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot,DeLille
US,"The grapes come mainly from the Rancho Santa Rosa vineyard, which is a great one, source to many top-scoring Chardonnays over the years. The wine is brisk,  tart and clean, with rich, dramatic flavors of pineapple, lime, honeysuckle and buttered toast. Really elegant and wonderful, and should blossom through early 2012.",94,36.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay,Longoria
US,"There's a note of chocolate peppermint alongside the blackberry and oak aromas that's intriguing, and it's echoed in the mouth. This is a deliciously flavored wine, but it's rather soft in both acids and tannins.",84,29.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Merlot,Carhartt Vineyard
Argentina,"A touch cooked and oaky, but with a sweet, friendly side, too. The palate rests on beefy fruit, and it's chewable and just slightly herbal in nature. Finishes leathery and tannic, with chocolate and coffee notes. Imported by Pernod Ricard, USA.",85,13.0,Other,San Juan,Cabernet Sauvignon,Graffigna
Argentina,"A little bit funky and unsettled when you pop the screwcap, but soon it finds its floral, blueberry base. Remains superficial and sweet in the mouth, with candied flavors, vanilla and mild oak. Highly regular; could use more concentration and density.",84,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Mariana
US,"There's a touch of Riesling-like petrol to the nose of this best-barrels Chardonnay from Testarossa, as well as dried citrus, fresh roasted cashews and Chinese almond cookie. The palate is very soft, with ripe fruit such as baked oranges. A nicely buttered touch bolsters the refreshing, mouthwatering acidity.",93,61.0,California,California,Chardonnay,Testarossa

US,"Made without oak, although the wine has a tart leanness that would have benefited from a little barrel exposure. Nonetheless, it's dry and crisp and minerally, with modest pineapple, Meyer lemon and flower flavors.",86,18.0,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay,Sebastiani
France,"Ripe, spicy wine that already has a more mature flavor of almonds and green herbs to go with the acidity and juicy white currants. There is a final bite of fruit skin tightness to what is a rich wine. Imported by Palm Bay International.",86,34.0,Burgundy,Montagny,Chardonnay,Labouré-Roi
US,"The acidity and asperity of this Chard are a bit beyond my comfort zone, but that's Edna Valley for you.

US,"Initial wafts of cannabis-like herbs quickly emerge into lime pith, limestone, struck match and oyster shells, with white flowers and yeastiness showing as well. There's a vivid tension between tart apple flesh and citrus pith on the palate, with lemon curd and pineapple elements arriving over time. Sit on this until 2017 so the acid can mellow, then drink through 2027.",91,60.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay,Brewer-Clifton
Italy,"Here's a Cab Sauvignon-Cab Franc blend that is redolent of mature fruit, strawberry and blueberry preserves. There is enough depth and sophistication here to keep it interesting thanks to background renderings of spice, chocolate and moist tobacco. It tastes slight sweet and chewy in the mouth and ends with tart tannins.",88,24.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Red Blend,Podere San Luigi
Argentina,"Cavas Weinert is an old-school Mendoza winery and it holds its wines longer than most, which is why this 2002 is just now a new release.

Decant for best results.",90,23.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Weinert

Italy,"Here's a rich and thickly extracted Barbera d'Alba with purplish hues to its ruby color and bright aromas of cherry, black currants and cassis. Like many of the wines from the Alba area, we notice quite a lot of toast here that comes forth as cinnamon, vanilla and exotic spice.",89,32.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,Barbera,Elvio Cogno

France,"Importer Bobby Kacher has a seemingly limitless portfolio of bargains from the south of France, and this one boasts an intriguing nose of pear, honey and star anise.

US,"A fancy, rich Chardonnay, made in the California style. Chappellet has a good track record of producing 90-plus Chardonnays, and this '09 continues that tradition.

Spain,"An aggressive wine with very little charm or character to back up its edgy verve. The nose is skunky while the palate tastes of pickled red cabbage and sharp berry flavors. A weak product reflective of a cool, nongiving vintage.",80,10.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Tempranillo,Condado de Oriza
US,"Combines power with delicacy to produce a savory, complex young Pinot Noir. Shows a silky texture and crisp coastal acidity, with potent flavors of ripe red cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, beef jerky and black pepper. Delicious and dry. Best now–2012.",92,39.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Noir,Kynsi

France,This demonstrates a fine balance between the crisp white and peach fruits and the nervy texture that keeps this feeling taut and sharp. Beneath the fruity surface there is structure and a mineral character. Age for another 2–3 years.,87,34.0,Burgundy,Chablis,Chardonnay,Domaine L. Chatelain
US,"Scented with notes of pine needle and lemon polish, this puts its concentration square in the mid-palate. There are pretty traces of honeyed botrytis, and a suggestion of sweetness, though the acidity keeps it on the dry side. Excellent length, with a pretty finish of honey and tea.",90,15.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Riesling,Convergence Zone
France,"In this smoky, black currant- and damson-flavored wine, the tannins have a firm, chewy structure, derived from the Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. With the final lip-smacking acidity, this should age impressively.",93,24.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Figeac
Italy,Lambrusco I Quercioli opens with a dark ruby color and pink foam that fizzes when the wine is poured into the glass.

Argentina,"Mint and rubber band scents open the bouquet, and then black fruit and marmalade aromas take over. This Bonarda is riper, softer and more cuddly than most, with ultraripe black-fruit flavors and soft tannins that make it borderline sappy. Plump, easygoing and loaded with fruit. Drink now to get the soft, giving side of this grape.",89,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Bonarda,Dante Robino
France,"Under the management of Céline Villars-Foubet, and the same ownership as Châteaux Ferrière and La Gurgue, this is always one of the most popular estates in the Médoc. This 2002 shows why, with its ripe, open fruit and sweet tannins. It should develop well over 5–10 years, but will be drinkable sooner.",90,24.0,Bordeaux,Moulis-en-Médoc,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Chasse-Spleen
US,"Another spectacular Dolce, which continues the brand's string of successes and further emphasizes its standing as one of California's greatest- white dessert wines. It lacks a touch of the concentration found in the 2006, but it dazzles nonetheless with intricate, sweet flavors of honey, butterscotch, golden-apricot nectar, orange marmalade, pineapple tart, vanilla and buttered toast. And all that is brightened by crisp acidity. Terrific to drink now, and it will hold in a proper cellar for a decade. The blend is 82% Sémillon and 18% Sauvignon Blanc.",96,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,Dolce
US,"The “architects” name refers to the four vineyards that constitute the blend: Laetitia, La Encantada, Firepeak and Bien Nacido. The wine's purity is proof that a great Pinot does not have to come from a single vineyard. It's bone dry and full-bodied in tannins, with complex flavors of black cherries, red currants, Dr. Pepper cola and exotic Asian spices. It was raised in one-year old oak, which gives smoky vanilla and caramel notes, in just the right proportion, to the fruit.",93,55.0,California,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Cadre

Italy,"Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot from the Sanmichele vineyard of the Serramarrocco estate are blended to produce a thick, inky Sicilian red that is redolent of blackberry, dried prune, rum cake and exotic clove or cardamom. Pair this richly textured red with stewed beef or game meat.",90,24.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,Red Blend,Tenuta di Serramarrocco
US,"One of the ripest, highest alcohol Mondavi Reserve Cabs in memory, this wine is forward in cassis and cherry flavors, and while the tannins are pretty sturdy, it's sweet and soft enough to drink now. It definitely has the rich mouthfeel you want in a pricey Napa Cab. But it's young; cellar this one until at least 2010.",92,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Mondavi

Australia,"A relatively restrained, minerally version of Australian Chardonnay, with a touch of graphite to the crisp pear aromas. Some gently toasted nut notes impart richness of texture and complexity on the palate. Long and slightly tannic on the finish, this could develop well over the next 2–3 years.",90,28.0,South Australia,South Australia,Chardonnay,Jacob's Creek

France,"A young, very fruity wine produced by Christian Moueix. It is structured, firm and juicy, layered with dry tannins, probably needing 6–12 months of aging. A touch of pepper, red currants, toast and acidity complete this good, very Bordeaux, wine.",84,11.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Christian Moueix
US,"This is exactly what Merlot should taste like, and you get it for a pretty nice price. Dry and velvety, it has immediately likeable flavors of red cherries, smoky bacon, violets, peppery spices and a lovely coat of sandalwood. Drink this lush, smooth wine now.",92,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Merlot,Magness
Italy,"This Rosso di Montalcino offers a distinctive nose of clove, spice, and pipe tobacco over a thick layer of cherry and blackberry fruit. The clove or eucalyptus element is unique indeed and the wine offers impressive smoothness and silkiness in the mouth.",89,24.0,Tuscany,Rosso di Montalcino,Sangiovese Grosso,Tenuta Poggio il Castellare
US,"It's made from all estate fruit, though it's not labeled as such. This was the first vintage from a newly planted 6-acre vineyard. There's good color and ripe cherry fruit, but also some rough, green tannins and a hint of garlic in the nose.",84,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Syrah,Kiona
Italy,"This opens with aromas of toasted oak, espresso and a hint of tire rubber. The palate displays sweet black cherry extract layered with milk chocolate, coffee and oak alongside bracing tannins and racy acidity. Drink after 2018.",88,80.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Andrea Oberto
Italy,"Zibibbo is usually presented as a passito dessert wine, but this is dry. The natural floral fragrance of the variety emerges on the nose, while the mouthfeel and the honey and peach flavors are detailed with acids.",86,35.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,Zibibbo,Barraco
Italy,"Gold in color and sweet, but still healthy enough to rate well. Honey, syrup and peaches carry the nose, while the palate is full of pear, banana and toasted nuts. The soft, chewy mouthfeel warns that this should be drunk soon.",86,9.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,Chardonnay,MandraRossa
US,"Finally, a Zin that bursts with ripe, rich fruit, but isn't high in alcohol or sugary sweet.

Drink now.",90,30.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"This canary yellow Sémillon is always estate grown and 100% varietal. An imposing 14.2% alcohol, this exudes a complex bouquet of beeswax, lemon curd and honey. Rich and thick, yet dry and persistent, it brings together suggestions of grain, citrus and tropical fruits.",90,15.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sémillon,Beresan
France,"A mineral-dominated wine, the fruit a whisper behind tight steeliness. The acidity contributes to the somewhat austere character, although the wood does round out the final flavor. Needs time. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",89,43.0,Burgundy,Monthélie,Chardonnay,Xavier Monnot
US,"A blend of Cabernet and 16% Syrah. It's quite dense and black in the style of the winery, and powerfully scented with black cherry, loganberry and cedar. It tastes like a berry pie with cedary/leafy highlights. The finish shows interesting tobacco and cigar notes.",89,32.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Basel Cellars

It finishes slightly tart in dried herb and mushroom.",87,40.0,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong
US,"Deep, dark blueberry fruit meets with beef char, fudge chocolate and espresso-bean notes on the nose of this blend of 59% Petite Sirah, 15% Syrah, 14% Tannat, 7% Petit Verdot, 4% Grenache and 1% Viognier. The rigid tannins need a little more time to open, but the zesty blueberry, blackberry and black-pepper flavors shine across the fresh, sizzling acidity.",90,48.0,California,Paso Robles,Red Blend,MCV

Australia,"This lush, full-throttle Cab is organically grown and includes 14% Petite Verdot. Intense mint, chocolate and blueberry aromas waft out of the glass. It's firm and tightly structured, but at once evenly textured and mouthfilling. Layers of tobacco, more mint, leather, chocolate and blueberry flavors coat the palate. Hardy tannins will soften with cellaring, but the fruit/acid/tannin balance is very good. It finishes long and complex, with that blueberry note. Editors' Choice.",93,16.0,South Australia,Langhorne Creek,Cabernet Sauvignon,Temple Bruer
France,91–93. Barrel sample. The second wine of Cheval Blanc is surprisingly soft and ripe—full of blackberry fruits—with delicious acidity and a lingering black-currant aftertaste.,92,24.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Le Petit Cheval
US,"Rather rough-hewn at the age of four-plus years, with charred, vanilla-scented oak dominating the fruit. Below that is a sea of blackberries, cherries and currants. The tannins are tough and sharp. Not showing particularly well now, and could gain in the bottle. May be better after 2011.",87,60.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Newton
US,"A seductive nose, densely loaded with black currants and smoke, leads into a textural, single-vineyard, 100% Cabernet with great varietal presence and definition. It needs to breathe open, which puts on more flesh, and starts to unpack the layers. Streaks of mineral, iron, graphite and more cassis roll into the finish.",91,32.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Seven Hills
US,"There is a horsey, leathery scent as you first experience this wine. It penetrates into the mouth, a stand-off against the sweet/tart boysenberry fruit. Suspect it will be a love it/hate it type of wine, depending upon your appreciation of leather.",85,26.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Baco Noir,Melrose
Australia,"This winery uses ample amounts of oak, but in years when the fruit concentration matches that intensity the wines can be compelling. Cedar and vanilla notes frame blackberry and cassis fruit in this firmly structured wine that folds in savory notes of roasted beef and black olive on the finish. Drink 2020–2030.",93,38.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,Shiraz,Chapel Hill

Italy,"Here's a bright Friulano with a luminous golden color and intense aromas of honey, peach and passion fruit.

Italy,"Aromas recall ripe berry and blue flower with a balsamic note. The structured but seemingly weightless palate delivers layers of ripe raspberry, juicy dark cherry, clove and licorice alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. An intense mineral note signals the close. Drink 2017–2027.",92,58.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Etna,Red Blend,Girolamo Russo
US,"Like Pinot Noir, Tempranillo is a tempermental, unforgiving variety. This '05 is ripe, and offers baked cherry pie, currant, vanilla and cedar-mint flavors. It's somewhat coarse and hot now, but could develop bottle complexity as time goes by.",86,40.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Tempranillo,Longoria
US,"Even at four-plus years, this interesting Syrah needs a little more time to show its best because, while it's very good now, it's tight in tannins that shut the palate down. Decanting will help, and so will big, rich foods such as duck and lamb. But the cherry, blackberry, white pepper and sweet leather flavors will blossom after 2008, and the wine should hold and improve through 2011.",91,22.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Syrah,Forth

US,"A vital, focused Cabernet, this shows the sheer classiness of Oakville in its concentrated blackberry and black currant fruit. It's seemingly sweet and dry at the same time, and the tannins, which are extraordinarily thick, are fine and pure. Irresistably delicious now, this changes in the glass by the second. It suggests it wants some time in the cellar, so drink now–2021.",96,85.0,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon,Piña
US,"The label shows a 1936 Chevy one ton flatbed truck; the same truck is parked out in front of the winery.

Italy,"This Bordeaux-inspired blend (2005 is the second vintage made) represents the collaborative effort of Lodovico Antinori and Michel Rolland.

US,"A Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this has a nose that erupts with scents of ripe, macerated strawberries, red currant preserves and briny black olives. Medium to full bodied, it feels loose and agile upon entrance before the tannic structure gains footing on the midpalate. Hints of graphite and cedar shade in the finish.",87,29.0,Virginia,Virginia,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Stinson

US,"My experience of Swan Pinots is that they've been made the same way for a long time, and require aging. This one shows some hard tannins and even some tough acids, although it's tremendous in cherry-pie filling, black raspberry and blackberry jam flavors. Right now it feels juvenile, rude, even rustic, but five to eight years in the cellar will reward.",90,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"This Merlot-dominant red blend displays classic Yakima Valley flavors that are well-integrated and balanced for medium-term (6–8 years) aging. The fruit is on the tart side, with accents of earth and herb. The tannins are textural and somewhat drying.",89,25.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Red Blend,Sheridan Vineyard
US,"Way too tannic to drink now, a hard, drily astringent young wine that makes your mouth feel like sandpaper. So will it age? There are some deep, good berry-cherry flavors, but the tannins are so fierce, they'll probably outlast the fruit.",85,40.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Ridge
Italy,"A pure expression of the Raboso grape (a native variety of northern Italy), Rabià is a dark wine with meaty, thick aromas of mature blackberry and sour cherry.

US,"A fig, herb and grapefruit bouquet sets the stage. The fig element becomes a more nut-like flavor on the palate and the wine has a round, slightly viscous texture, in the full style of the other Wattle Creek whites. Finishes dry, with just a hint of tartness.",87,20.0,California,Sonoma County,Sauvignon Blanc,Wattle Creek
Argentina,"The label says fumé and the nose leaves no doubt that the wine was barrel aged because cinnamon and toast are all over it. Yet the flavor profile is rather tangy, with mango and apple leading the way. Holds form on the finish. Not a common style for Sauvignon Blanc.",85,25.0,Other,Cafayate,Sauvignon Blanc,Michel Torino
US,"This is a big Zinfandel, high in alcohol and packed with detail. Just erupts in a burst of blackberry jam, cherry pie filling, currant, milk chocolate and anise flavors, liberally dusted with fresh cracked peppercorn.",87,36.0,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel,Peachy Canyon

Italy,"Costera is a Cannonau-based wine (with some Carignano and Bovale) that sees a very light passing in wood. The result is a fruit-driven wine with a pinch of exotic spice and soft tannins. The real protagonist here, however, are the jammy, ripe berry notes.",87,18.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Cannonau di Sardegna,Cannonau,Argiolas
France,"A rare rosé Champagne whose color comes from Pinot Noir skins rather than from added red wine, this has vivid colors of orange and onion skin.

Italy,"Est! Est!! Est!!! takes its name from an ancient legend in which a bishop desired some good wine on his travels to Rome.

Italy,"Here's a fabulous 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah that offers black, thick consistency and meaty aromas of cured beef, peppercorn, smoke, tobacco and loads of luscious dark berry fruit. It's a soft, velvety wine with a plush, soft finish.",91,40.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Red Blend,Tenuta San Giorgio
US,"This is a rather deep yellow straw color, and follows in the style of the winery's distinctive 2005 bottling, with a rich blend of scents and flavors. Lemon polish, jasmine and honey-soaked apricots, tea and tangerines all conjoin in a dense, concentrated and lush wine. The finish carries on with honey, toasted almonds, flowers and an Alsatian oiliness. It's one of the most concentrated and unique Rieslings produced in a state known for them.",92,22.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Riesling,Smasne Cellars

France,"An atypical offering, this full-bodied Riesling possessing a slightly oily texture is saturated with a creamy butteryness and earthy essences such as mushroom and truffle. While hints of white peach might surface in the mouth, it is surprisingly easy to take pleasure in its other slightly odd and unexpected characteristics.",87,24.0,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling,Marc Kreydenweiss
US,"A witch's brew of five grapes, the Abondante is a fine wine to pair with pizza, offering interesting flavors of berry and stone fruit. What it lacks in focus, it makes up for with plenty of fruit and some unusual complexity.",88,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend,Sineann
US,"This wine brings a lot of appeal, with notes of mandarin orange, Bosc pear and jasmine. It leans toward medium-sweet with ripe peach flavors but without the acid to hold them entirely together.",88,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling,Pacific Rim
US,"Amazingly rich, one of the most opulent Chardonnays you can drink now. Just wows the mouth with pineapple, pear, exotic tropical fruit, crème brûlée, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on through the finish. Also shows fine, tart acidity, which provides needed balance. Yes, it's superripe, but this is what California Chardonnay does at its best.",95,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem
Argentina,"Burnt and roasted up front, with a leathery nose that doesn't convey freshness. Feels choppy and acidic, with herbal, semitart flavors of burnt berry fruit. Minty and green on the finish.",82,16.0,Other,Calchaquí Valley,Malbec,Michel Torino

Australia,"I suspect the Cyril Henschke Cabernets show better after additional bottle age, but on release they are invariably difficult to read. There is no denying the attractive scents of mint, smoke and cassis in the 2004, nor the ripe plum and cassis-driven flavors, but the wine seems tight and reined in on the palate. Try after 2012.",90,110.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Henschke
US,"Succulent apricot and creamy vanilla add to the round, full-bodied expression of this robust white wine, the Sémillon blended with 15% Sauvignon Blanc from a single vineyard. A thickness of caramel and more vanilla rises on the finish.",86,26.0,California,Napa Valley,Sémillon,V. Sattui
Spain,"Meaty and composed, with an earthy nose that carries plenty of dark fruit and minty herbal accents. The palate shows clarity and density, but it's a touch gritty, hard and tannic. Flavors of cola, blackberry and burnt toast are masculine, while the finish is also kind of crusty and dark.",88,48.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,Garnacha,Pegaso
US,"A difficult Pinot Noir to evaluate. It's very dry, acidic and tannic, with sharp flavors of blackberries that sweeten into jam on the finish. The question is one of ageability. Try cellaring for five years and see what happens.",87,54.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir,Testarossa

France,"Bears a striking resemblance to blueberry pie in its aromas. Lighter than expected on the palate, before fading on the finish. A pleasant lunch mate to pâté or charcouterie.",84,8.0,Rhône Valley,Costières de Nîmes,Rhône-style Red Blend,Château d'Or et de Gueules
US,"For a reserve, this seems surprisingly light, attenuated and acidic. The cranberry/strawberry fruit, of modest weight and depth, offers barely a hint of the 100% new French oak—just a faint flavor of hazelnuts and milk chocolate.",87,55.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Methven Family Vineyards

US,"This first estate-grown bottling of Rediviva is 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 45% Syrah. Amazing aromatic complexity grabs you and leads you into the dark interior of the wine, a riot of red and black fruits, moist earth, smoke, anise, herb and toast. Power and elegance combined, with the structure to age for a decade or more.",96,48.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah,Buty
US,"The tannic structure of this Cab is front and center, both anchoring the wine and making it inaccessible now. But there's little doubt about its ageability. The balance is great, and the heart of blackberry and cherry fruit is just bursting to get out. Defines Napa mountain Cab, and needs to be cellared. Should hit its stride in 2011 and hold for another 10 years.",93,60.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon,Martin Ray

Australia,"A relatively new wine in the Yalumba stable, the Scribbler evokes a blend of cherries and cassis, with almost floral herb and tea nuances.

US,"Brander keeps trying to get Cabernet ripe down in Santa Ynez, and while they sometimes come close, it's like horseshoes: close doesn't count at this price.

Oddly, I liked the regular '04 Cab better.",83,50.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Brander
Italy,"Each spring, Sicily is covered with bushes of wild fennel and if you pay close attention you can smell its pungent fragrance on this 100% Cabernet.

Pair this with Asian fare, ham or a green salad with grapefruit sections.",86,14.0,California,Paso Robles,Sauvignon Blanc,Robert Hall

Italy,"Here is a classic expression of Barolo from a very good vintage that opens with bright fruit aromas that are embellished by carefully measured oak tones.

Australia,"The 2002 is a very interesting rendition of the 707. On the palate, juicy plums and berries are doused in Indian spices—curry and the whole lot.

Argentina,"Not a bad value. The wine is a touch reduced and short on mouthfeel and aromatics, but it still delivers creamy vanilla flavors, raspberry essence and decent density. The sum of all its parts is better than the individual components. Best now, and in casual settings.",84,8.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Telteca
Spain,"Ripe peach aromas come with mild oxidized notes and waxy apple scents. This is mouthfilling yet fresh in feel, with punchy acidity. Flavors of baked, spiced apple are a touch briny, and continued similarly to the balanced finish.",87,27.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Garnacha Blanca,Fernández Gómez
Italy,"A Barolo superstar on the rise—keep a close watch on the wines of Gianni Gagliardo and family.

US,"This pale-colored wine is light in texture, with a sheer, silk and satin, airy mouthfeel that reminds you of tea. It's also very acidic, and filled with youthfully immature fruit and spice. Brings to mind certain great Burgundies on release. It should be exciting to age this wine past 2008.",91,54.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Pinot Noir,Testarossa

France,"A blend from all his vines, this is Alain Cailbourdin's wood aged top wine.

It makes a great food wine; drink now.",90,24.0,Loire Valley,Pouilly-Fumé,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine A. Cailbourdin

US,"Sharp and penetrating, vertically structured, and just now coming out of its youthful shell, the 2006 is beginning to show its long- term aging potential.

Drink now.",86,23.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,Verdejo,José Pariente
US,"The vineyard is noted for the quality of its Syrahs, and this one is right up there, although as currently constituted, it's a bit too young. Shows thick tannins and very ripe flavors of blackberry jam, cassis, cherry liqueur, melted dark chocolate, violets and a wonderful appliqué of cedar, finished with crunchy black pepper. Better by the winter of 2009, with slow-braised short ribs.",93,38.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Syrah,Rockroom Winemaking Cooperative

US,"Pretty and complex, this delivers a mélange of interesting flavors. Round, tart fruits—berries and sour plum— mingle with dried leaves, cut tobacco and mushroom.

Delicious already, it can be cellared for another 5–6 years.",92,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley Vineyards

Spain,"More up the ladder from Vitoria's crianza, but also more raisiny and oaky. The wine develops nicely with air, shedding raisin for more of the fruit spectrum.

Drink now through 2013.",88,27.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo,Marqués de Vitoria

US,"Ripe and seductive with cherries and sweet cranberries, this young, tight, stylish Pinot has nothing but clear sailing ahead. There's excellent concentration through the midpalate, a light touch with the new oak, and beautifully textured fruit throughout. Love it now or leave it for later; you can't lose either way.",91,38.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Lemelson
US,"From old, head-trained vines near St. Helena comes this dense, intense young wine. It's all Napa in the claret-like structure that's built upon firm, refined tannins. Shows waves of blackberries, black  currants, dark chocolate and peppery spices.",93,37.0,California,Napa Valley,Zinfandel,Elyse
Italy,"This Barbera d'Alba is aged 15 months in oak and boasts well-defined notes of exotic spice, cigar box and shades of sweet vanilla.

Spain,"Big and sultry as always, with bacon, smoke, black fruit and a full rack of spices making for a wonderful bouquet. Concentrated and ripped for a 2007, with blackberry, clove, pepper, cinnamon and vanilla flavors. And then comes tobacco and more spice on the finish, which is grabby but understandable because it's so young. Best from 2012 through 2019.",93,176.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Tinto Fino,Emilio Moro

US,"Aromas of espresso and burnt biscotti entice on this dark yet elegant Cab. On the palate, fresh violets linger amidst layers of ripe black fruit, smoke and char towards a stout, moderately tannic finish. Quite pleasant now, but could improve with 3–5 years of bottle aging.",87,32.0,Virginia,Virginia,Cabernet Sauvignon,Annefield Vineyards
Spain,"Meaty, earthy and dark, with a powerful consitution along with briar and sharpness. In the mouth, it's a touchy customer with biting tannins, but as it unfolds you get a dark palate of black fruit, coffee, chocolate and spice. Big in flavor but not as complete or lush as in the past, which is a reflection of the vintage. Drink now through 2016.",91,32.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Tinto Fino,Dominio de Atauta

US,"This wonderfully rich wine combines the best of all three varieties to produce a complex white. It shows rich green apple, pineapple jam, superripe apricot, honeysuckle and smoky oak flavors, and while it's tremendously honeyed on the finish, it is basically dry.

US,"Craig's Howell Mountain Cab typically is powerful and ripe, with bigtime tannins that require aging. The 2005 is such a wine.

Should negotiate the next 10 years with ease.",92,80.0,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Craig
Argentina,"Ripe, healthy and pure, with familiar aromas and flavors of cassis and berries. In the mouth, it's bright and lively, with plenty of acidity but no sheering, harsh qualities.

US,"Merlot (80%) is in the lead on this blend, with the rest rounded out by Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Malbec.

This was a particularly good vintage for Pepper Bridge fruit, but even so the fruit is not quite up to the challenge of matching the barrel flavors, and quickly subsides.",88,33.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Dynasty Cellars
Spain,"Rusty in color, with initial aromas of smoke, dried leaves, herbs, tobacco and subtle berry.

Italy,"Primitivo is Zinfandel, according to University of California at Davis ampelographers (students of grape DNA), but that doesn't mean they taste the same, as this medium-weight southern Italian version proves. Dark cherry, leather, coffee and cocoa predominate here, with some nice spice, tar and a slight black pepperiness (maybe that's the Zin gene) on the finish.",85,9.0,Southern Italy,Puglia,Primitivo,Canaletto

Absolutely delicious, wonderfully elegant, and should age well for a decade.",94,61.0,California,Stags Leap District,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chimney Rock
US,"With different vineyard sources and blend from the excellent 2006, this is still a clear improvement, with true varietal character.

The listed alcohol remains under 14%.",91,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah,Waterbrook

US,"This is one of Von Strasser's newer bottlings, with the grapes planted only in 2001. It is a designation to watch for its intensity, purity and longevity. Enormously focused in black currants, dark chocolate and moo shu plum sauce, it shows the hard tannins of a young Diamond Mountain Cab. The winemaker has unusually added a small percentage of Zinfandel to the blend. Should begin to blossom after 2018.",93,80.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon,Von Strasser
US,"Although this is the least costly of the winery's Pinots, it's a lovely wine. Blending from a vast source of vineyards has given winemaker Cabral the ability to fill in divots of every kind. Gentle and dry, this rich, complex Pinot Noir has the elegance and style you expect from Williams Selyem.",92,34.0,California,Sonoma County,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Farrell likes to pick early, and thus trades opulence for acidity, elegance and possible ageworthiness. Here you'll find a tight, lemony wine, very crisp. The wine is marked by oak and lees, which add flavor and textural nuances, but it remains flinty and austere.",90,38.0,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay,Gary Farrell

Argentina,"From 83-year-old vines, this is an opaque wine with pastry/graham cracker aromas and a little bit of leather and funk. The palate has hard-hitting, cheek-slapping tannins and dense but herbal plum, blackberry and salinic flavors. It's not elegant or sleek, but it is big, thick and makes its point.",88,19.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Malbec,Familia Mayol
US,"This pure Marsanne was whole-cluster pressed and fermented in French oak barrels—30% of which were new. It's full and flavorful, and it has a lemony richness that's streaked with veins of butterscotch and marzipan. As with all of this winery's 2011 white wines, the aromatics are excellent and the length is exceptional.",92,35.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Marsanne,Maison Bleue
Argentina,"Lively black cherry and plum aromas indicate that this slightly older wine is still vibrant and healthy.

Australia,"The most successful of the three Shottesbrooke Cabernets in 2005,  this features bold cassis fruit that's almost grapy in its intensity, framed by toasty, vanilla-scented oak. It's full-bodied and muscular with a firm, crisp finish, factors that suggest it should improve over the next 2–3 years. A blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot and 5% Malbec.",89,39.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,Cabernet Blend,Shottesbrooke
US,"A welcome return to form after the disappointing 2005. Massive, dark, saturated and spicy; laden with black fruits, smoke and charcoal.

Spain,"Full and fruity, but with an aromatic pinch of latex and rubber that subsides with airing.

The wine is entirely unoaked, and did not undergo the malolactic fermentation, but it was aged on its lees. That allows the acidity to star, and what brilliant acidity it is.

For all that, the wine is elegant, silky and refined. Delicious now, although a little tannic, and will benefit from decanting and aging. Bring on the steak.",96,80.0,California,Sta.

US,"This pure Cabernet is a stubborn beast—a full 24 hours after being opened it was still shut down tightly, almost as if bottle shocked. Just a hint of leather in the nose, with extremely compact black fruits and firm tannins.",86,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,DaMa
France,"A powerful smoky, wood-aged Bordeaux blend. It is dominated by the tense black-currant flavor of Cabernet Sauvignon, giving a structured and elegant wine that remains rich. It will certainly age for over 4–5 years or more.",91,20.0,Southwest France,Bergerac,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château K

Australia,"Prices have soared for this bottling, which used to be an excellent value within the Penfolds stable. The quality is still excellent, with this 2010 offering plenty of weight and power.

France,"A full, very low-acid wine, thanks to the hot summer. To compensate, though, there are fine wood and tropical fruit flavors, which lend spice and an exotic element to the wine. Unlike the 2002 from the same property, this wine should be drunk soon",87,22.0,Bordeaux,Premieres Côtes de Blaye,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Haut Bertinerie
Italy,There's an awkward note here that recalls Amaretto layered over lemon soda. The wine tastes spicy in the mouth with more bitter almond on the close.

Spain,"Serious, stately Rioja with key aromas of prune, blackberry and leather. Snappy enough on the palate, with plenty of pop as well as pure berry flavors, smooth tannins, zest and dry vanilla.

Spain,"Fairly mineral on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas rounding out the bouquet. Quite fresh and crisp, yet a bit hollow in the midpalate and on the finish.

Spain,"Gold in color and short on bubbles, but heavy on sweetness and residual sugar. That said, it's an advertised semidry, so a certain level of cloy is expected.

Spain,"Big in color, with meaty, rubbery aromas that seem reduced and gaseous. The palate is black and toasty, but sort of rubbery. Burnt toast, black coffee and some bitterness control the finish. More colorful and big than flavorful and complete.",83,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo Blend,Lar de Sotomayor

Spain,"Dark to the eye, with bacon, ham, spice and savory fruit aromas. The palate is extracted and grating in feel, with dark berry, herb, pepper, smoke and barrel resin flavors.

Italy,"Made from 80-year-old Glera vines that have never been doused with herbicides or pesticides, this boasts an enticing floral fragrance of jasmine and honeysuckle.

It finishes crisp and clean.",91,30.0,Veneto,Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Glera,Ca' dei Zago

Australia,"Water Wheel wines consistently deliver quality and value. The winery's 2007 Shiraz is made in a decadently supple, drink-now style with enough cocoa and mocha overtones to bring chocolate cake to mind. There's some cedar and spice complexity as well.

US,"This is a 40-40 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, with the balance consisting of Merlot. It's a barrel selection of the winery's best lots, from its various vineyards, and has been aged in 100% new French oak. Yet it's not oaky at all, with the wood bringing only additional sweet, smoky richness to the red currants, cherries, dark chocolate and spices. This is a superb wine, delicious right out of the bottle, but it should develop and, depending on your tastes, improve over the next 20 years.",95,135.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Von Strasser
Italy,"The nice thing about Ripasso Secco Bertani is that it shows enormous harmony between its various parts. The nose is bigger, so to speak, with vibrant aromas of red fruit and soft spice.

US,"This is a serious red wine, powerful and authoritative in Petite Sirah character, but be forewarned, it's pretty tannic, and nowhere near ready. That probably won't stop most folks from popping the cork now, and they'll like the blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors just fine withgrilled steaks and chops. But the wine will develop fascinating bottle complexities for many years.",92,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Petite Sirah,Miner
Argentina,"Fairly muddled and earthy at first blush, with a leafy, raisiny, burnt set of aromas. Tastes and feels mealy, with roasted cherry and raspberry flavors and then a leathery finish.

Italy,"From the region of Monferrato, this joyous wine just oozes youth, from its vivid purple hue to its fruity-perfumey aromas and bright flavors of cherries and plums.

US,"Not a shy wine, but quite lively on the palate, loaded with high-toned fruits and bright acids. This is an interesting flavor mix, not jammy despite the high alcohol.

It's interesting and complex; a little on the green side.",87,30.0,Washington,Washington,Red Blend,Merry Cellars

Italy,"This is a crisp expression of Nebbiolo that is finessed and elegant. It opens with dusty aromas of dried currant, crushed stone and black pepper. The tannins are solid and polished; it needs at least 10 more years of cellar aging.",90,58.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Nebbiolo,Rizzi
US,"A dried herb kick is the hallmark of wines made by this producer, and this bottling may wear that note best, its fresh-pressed blackberry aromas accented with thyme and oregano. The palate blends those savory tones with light purple fruit and caramel and coffee touches, finishing on peppery spice.",91,49.0,California,Paso Robles,Syrah,Cass
US,"A very fine Cabernet, although it's tough and young and wants time in the cellar. Strikes you immediately as lush and important, with a fine structure framing ripe flavors of blackberries, black cherries, currants, anise, dark chocolate and sandalwood. Yet there's a juvenile character that, good as it is, promises even better things down the road. Give it until 2013, at least.",93,70.0,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt

US,"A bit burly in tannins, with a dry, sandpapery mouthfeel. But that doesn't stop the blackberry, black cherry and currant fruit from shining through, or put a damper on the sweet, toasty oak notes. Doesn't feel like an ager, so the tannins are here to stay, but a good steak will wrestle them into submission.",90,35.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clos du Val
US,"A big, thick, ripe Pinot Noir that needs time in the cellar. Right now it's all primary berry and cola fruit, with the anise and pine needle notes you often find in better Sonoma Coast Pinot Noirs. It's also pretty tannic.

Give this plenty of breathing time.",84,24.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Tempranillo,Righteous
US,"The aging in 40% American oak shows in a somewhat pickley note; this still seems to be a bit disjointed, although it's been in bottle almost a full year.

France,"Medium sweet in character, this is a rich wine that's driven by its rich terroir.

Hints of nutmeg and cinnamon adorn the fruit, which lingers gently through a citrusy finish.",89,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,Ponzi

US,"Regional pioneer Rick Longoria delivers a savory, earthy wine from the vineyard he planted, with meaty aromas of shiitake and porcini mushrooms, black slate, cedar and fresh pomegranate. The palate is more reliant on peppery spice, rose-petal florals and dried herbs than fruit, though dried cherries make an appearance, especially on the lasting finish. It's great now, but will thrive for at least a decade. Drink 2018–2028.",92,55.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Noir,Longoria

Spain,"An attractive, ripe wine that pushes up against raisiny but then draws back to focus on blackberry, licorice and other dark aromas and flavors. Very good weight and mouthfeel, with nice balance supporting ripe berry, cola and mild chocolate flavors. Finishes lush and warm. Drink now through 2011.",90,30.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Tempranillo,Finca Torremilanos
US,"Ripe, lush and immediately attractive, this Chard offers rich tiers of pineapple custard, pear marmalade, vanilla, buttered toast, toasted coconut and Asian spice flavors. It's a strong, flamboyant wine that calls for equally strong foods, like lobster.",91,32.0,California,Carneros,Chardonnay,Barnett
US,"A little thin for a Chardonnay, but bone dry and elegant, with lemon and lime flavors and a touch of tangy minerals. Zesty acidity provides a brisk, mouthwatering scour. Easy to drink, at an easy price.",84,25.0,California,Monterey County,Chardonnay,Black Box
Argentina,"Sweet and baked smelling, with foxy core aromas that suggest wet dog fur. The palate is loud and wild, with foxy, unsettled flavors of wild berry and cherry. Runs low on layering, structure and body, but it is lively.",84,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Andeluna
Italy,"This boutique Chianti Classico (only 600 cases are made) has a modern, sweet-smelling nose with evident tones of toasted almond, vanilla and coconut that are framed by delicate nuances of blueberry and blue flower typical of Sangiovese. It's lean and compact in the mouth with a burst of fresh fruit on the close.",88,24.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,Sangiovese,Fattoria di Corsignano

US,"Loads of clove, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg spice show up the strawberry, blueberry and red cherry aromas of this lavish bottling, which also offers scents of crushed rock and turned earth. Similar elements entertain the palate, culminating with a minty pine needle note, proving to be a very dynamic sip.",90,65.0,California,Temecula Valley,Zinfandel,Lorenzi Estate
Italy,"Funky aromas of barnyard eventually burn off to reveal game, animal, rubber, earth and leather. The palate displays porcini mushroom with raw cherry, prune, nutmeg and dried sage. There's not much complexity and it's not an ager so enjoy over the next few years.",87,44.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Bosio
US,"Soft and juicy with abundant white peach and berry flavors, Belhurst's rosé is on the sweeter side of dry, but clean and focused on the palate. Refreshing yet substantial in body, it's perfect as an apéritif or an accompaniment to chicken or seafood.",87,19.0,New York,New York,Rosé,Belhurst

It is luminous and lightweight with a refreshing touch of acidity on the close.",85,9.0,Northwestern Italy,Riviera Ligure di Ponente,Vermentino,Colle dei Bardellini
Spain,"Clean, minerally, slightly green in aromatics and oh so approachable and nice. For an under-$15 white, this Godello from Monterrei excels with layered flavors of apple, minerals and natural spice. The finish is long and hints at fresh herbs like thyme and tarragon. Potentially superb with garlic shrimp or calamari over fresh greens.",90,14.0,Galicia,Monterrei,Godello,Pazos del Rey
US,"A bit on the hot side, reflecting the extra warmth that the Pope Valley region of eastern Napa Valley gets during the summer. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's massively flavored, huge in jammy blackberries, cherries, cassis and dark chocolate. The tannins are considerable, the finish long and ripe. Best to open this wine by 2015 or so.",92,85.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,St. Supéry

Spain,"Herbal aromas come with bell pepper and berry fruit notes, while the palate is solid in terms of feel but shows classic Navarran flavors of jalapeño and green pepper. Good texture and mouthfeel, but probably too green for a lot of people. Tempranillo with Merlot and Cabernet is the blend.",85,12.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,Tempranillo Blend,Otazu
Argentina,"Can't say that the heavy dose of oak on this wine is helping the cause. The nose is quite resiny and cloying, while the palate is creamy and full, but loaded with wood chip and vanilla flavors. As might be expected, even more oak flavor dominates the finish.",83,17.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Chardonnay-Viognier,Nieto Senetiner
US,"Great balance, snappy acidity and concentrated fruit flavors make this grand wine especially appealing. The aromas of blackberry and red cherry are vibrant, the juicy, mouthwatering cherry flavors are dazzling and the finish lingers. It is balanced for good aging, so drink it from 2017–2020.",94,44.0,California,Mendocino County,Pinot Noir,Waits-Mast
France,"An intensely herbal, thyme-flavored wine, with a creaminess that enhances the full, but still very fresh character. Sauvignon Blanc's green character dominates, but is tamed by the ripeness of the fruit.",88,24.0,Bordeaux,Entre-Deux-Mers,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Tour de Mirambeau
Italy,"Mature plum, crushed violet and dark cooking spice aromas come together in the glass.

Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit.",87,14.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,Barbera,Cascina Liuzzi
Spain,"Jammy aromas mix with grassy green notes in front of a sweet, chunky palate that offers unconvincing, generic berry flavors. Devoid of elegance and character but loaded with heft and baked fruit. A sweet, rudimentary wine.",83,10.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Tempranillo,Legado Muñoz
US,"It's quite tannic, as is to be expected from this founding Red Mountain vineyard, and yet the wine seems smoothed over, buffed out. The black cherry and cassis fruit does not penetrate. Drink up.",87,60.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon,Covington
US,"There's a fine Pinot in here, but it's like buried treasure. Currently locked down with tannins, the wine shows extravagant flavors of dusty Asian spices, rhubarb, pomegranate, cola, cherryskin and sandalwood. Desperately needs time, but should be very fine. Drink 2011 through 2015.",93,50.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Pinot Noir,Fess Parker

US,"Hard to beat the Nuthouse for pure pleasure in the Argyle Pinot Noir lineup; it has substantial berry and cherry fruits, glistening with butterfat and gliding into toasted nuts and caramel flavors in the finish. There is some heat also, from alcohol reaching 14.5%—not excessive, but noticeable. This is wide-open and ready to drink with just a little breathing time.",89,60.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Argyle

France,"A soft wine that has easy but attractively ripe fruit. This is not a wine for aging, but in 2003, the estate has made a very drinkable wine. Patache stands for an ancient coaching inn, recollected on the wine's label by a coach and horses. Imported by Grands Chais de France.",85,24.0,Bordeaux,Médoc,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Patache d'Aux

Argentina,"Intriguing aromas of lavender, hoja santa and green tobacco blend nicely with blackberry and blueberry scents. This top-flight Bonarda feels lush and only moderately tannic. Blackberry, leather and mild briny flavors finish minty and lightly herbal. Drink now.",91,30.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Bonarda,El Enemigo
Spain,"Cherry and crisp red currant aromas are racy and tutti-frutti in character. The palate delivers kick and acidity in addition to dry, pithy flavors of citrus fruits and nectarine. Dryness persists onto the finish, which is friendly but modest.",85,8.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,Rosé,Borsao
Australia,"This wine starts off a bit tarry or rubbery, but decanting allows the bright berry fruit to come forward. Raspberries are limned with hints of mint and other herbs and framed by vanilla. It's medium-bodied, with a tangy finish and a crisp, satiny texture. Drink now.",87,15.0,South Australia,South Australia,Shiraz,Grant Burge
Argentina,"Quiet yet solid on the nose, with mild aromas of cassis and black fruits. The palate is a bit sharp with acidity but overall the wine is well made and clean, with red berry, plum and other standard flavors. Defines goodness while not pushing the envelope at all.",86,20.0,Mendoza Province,Alto Valle de Uco,Malbec,Finca [ñ]
US,"Rather heavy and super-fruity now, with fruitstand flavors of blackberries, cherries and plums. It's a ripely delicious wine, but a bit one-dimensional, not showing much elegance or subtlety. Could develop bottle nuance over the next 4–6 years.",87,32.0,California,Carneros,Syrah,Cuvaison
US,"A wonderful Zinfandel that perfectly captures the essence of Dry Creek Valley, while keeping alcohol modest and the overall structure elegant. Perfectly dry, the wine shows complex waves of cherries and cola. It's vast in peppery spices, with notes of all kinds of essences from the rocks and soil. Just lovely, a world-class Zinfandel.",92,35.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel,Nalle
Italy,"Tobacco, leather and graham cracker notes open the nose of this bold and chewy Merlot. There are flavors of dark cherry, plum and cassis, followed by touches of tangy spices. The tannins are round and soft, and the palate has a dense, chewy quality that would pair with succulent meat dishes.",92,60.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Merlot,Ceralti
US,"Heavy and jammy for a rosé, with strong flavors of cherry, oranges and raspberries. Made from Cabernet Sauvignon and Nebbiolo.",83,13.0,California,Central Coast,Rosé,Martin Ranch
US,"This is a dark, huge Pinot Noir, so rich and opulently fruity that it might almost be a Grenache. It has a thick, soft mouthfeel, and is explosive in cherry jam, red licorice and mocha flavors that are utterly delicious. However, there's a certain direct appeal that lacks complexity and nuance. Drink now and over the next few years.",88,60.0,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,Etude
France,"Balancing a ripe lime flavor with a note of rich peach and acidity, this shows the ability to age. Even though it is delicious now, it will age over several years.",93,50.0,Champagne,Champagne,Champagne Blend,Duval-Leroy
US,"Tight and acidic, with a sharpness that's a little cutting now, despite elaborate cherry pie filling, cola and red currant flavors. Could develop over the next few years, but it's a gamble.",87,52.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir,George IV
Australia,"This is a fresh and elegant take, a good choice for those who find some Shiraz to be heavy-handed. Spice and cedar scents lead to a medium-bodied palate with raspberry and plum fruit couched in velvety tannins. The medium finish is shot through with plum notes. Drink up or keep for a year.",86,15.0,South Australia,South Australia,Shiraz,Kilikanoon

Italy,There's a very beautiful floral element to this Inzolia from Sicily that helps it stand apart in a crowd. You'll get fragrant tones of jasmine and honeysuckle followed by peach and pineapple. The mouthfeel is creamy and rich.,87,14.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,Inzolia,Caruso & Minini
US,"This is the palest and lightest of Calera's ‘02 Pinots, but paradoxically it's enormously concentrated in flavor and possible the most ageworthy. It explodes with cherry cola, cherry pie filling, raspberry, blueberry, cocoa-dusted latte and cinnamon-nutmeg spice. But it has the depth and balance for the long haul. Best now through 2012.",93,58.0,California,Mt. Harlan,Pinot Noir,Calera

US,"Briary in taste and texture, with nettle, spicy pepper and bitter wild berryskin flavors, although there's enough cherry fruit to satisfy. An interesting wine of a place, with distinctive qualities.",87,45.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Del Carlo Winery
US,"This could be labeled Syrah, with just 17% Mourvèdre and small amounts of co-fermented Viognier and Roussanne in the mix. High-toned and complex, it wraps dark fruit in highlights of dried herbs, black olives and clean earth. The barrel aging—22 months in one quarter new French oak—brings in Bourbon barrel scents.",88,31.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Rhône-style Red Blend,Ott & Murphy
France,"There is a hint of flinty reduction that still clings to the nose. Underneath that is shy crisp red-cherry fruit. The palate adds glimpses of lifted conifer aromas to that. There is lightness and a very fine structure, but also depth. This is very elegant and understated but all the more touching for that. The finish is totally refreshing and dry.",91,34.0,Alsace,Alsace,Pinot Noir,Domaine Barmès-Buecher

US,"The texture is off, with hard and bitter tannins. The fruit also is quite ripe, with the black cherries veering into raisins. Oak sticks out in the form of sweet vanilla and toast. The result lacks harmony.",83,34.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Merlot,Burrell School Vineyards
France,"At this stage, the wine is closed up, the fruit quite tight. But it is extremely rich, the potential from the spice, broad white fruits and intense minerality all promising good aging.",94,145.0,Burgundy,Puligny-Montrachet,Chardonnay,Domaine Leflaive

Argentina,"Tropical and blowsy on the nose. The palate is now chunky and heavy, while the flavors are mustardy and oily, with fruit notes that fall into the melon, peach and orange field. Flat and short on the finish, which indicates that it's already fading. Better to wait for the 2010.",84,11.0,Other,Cafayate,Torrontés,O. Fournier
Italy,"A little sister to the estate's more expensive Bricco Asili cru expression of Barbaresco, this tonic, clean and firm wine is redolent of black currant, cherry cola, wild raspberry, violets, tar and Spanish cedar.

Spain,"A typically reserved Navarran wine is what this is. The nose offers dry red fruit, spice and not much else.

A nice and simple food wine.",85,13.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,Red Blend,Señorío de Sarria
US,"This is one to think about for its complex nature that changes by the moment. On the surface, it's soft and ripe, with an explosion of cherry pie, strawberry, cola and mocha flavors enriched with the vanilla and smoky caramel of new oak. Yet every sip as it warms in the glass reveals another layer. Gorgeously textured, right up there with the best.",94,60.0,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,Saintsbury

Italy,"This luminous wine breaks the myth that says Pinot Grigio is not a wine of depth or personality. You'll get both here in the form of peach, nectarine, honeysuckle and orange zest.

US,"Malbec is relatively new and rare in Washington, and it is still some years before most of the vines are mature, but the potential is there.

Italy,"Nuhar is an innovative blend of Nero d'Avola (70%) and Pinot Nero that surpasses expectations and does justice to both grape varieties.

The finish shows bright menthol and spearmint overtones.",87,16.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,Red Blend,Tenuta Rapitalà
US,"By calling it Fumé, instead of Sauvignon, Blanc, the winery telegraphs that the wine was aged in barrels.

US,"Aromas of char and toast are quite up front, though they smooth out over time and give way to lemon meringue.

The oak gets out front, but there are good things going on.",88,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay,Cloudlift Cellars
US,"A beautifully clean, crisply dry wine that offers plenty of minerals, but doesn't stint on the fruit.

US,"Kelley Fox, who also makes the Scott Paul wines, has a deceptively delicate touch with her Pinots. They may seem light and herbal at first, but on further examination there is plenty of fruit, and it's sufficiently ripe, just not jammy.

US,"A bit over the top in fruity extraction, a bomb blast of sweet raspberry, cherry and blackberry jam. It's almost like a dessert wine. Yet there's a lot of tannins and acidity, and who knows? It could do interesting things. At this price, buy a bottle and stick it in the cellar for six years.",87,22.0,California,Russian River Valley,Syrah,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"Shows a beautiful balance of all its parts. The fruit is forwardly ripe, showing cherries, blackberries and rich dark chocolate.

US,"Made in the modern Napa style, this Cab shows very ripe fruit, soft acids, buttery tannins and quite a bit of smoky new oak.

US,"Bone dry yet sweet in fruit, it shows the acids and tannins of this cool section of Napa Valley, which gives such excellent structure to the ripe blackberry and blueberry fruit.

Italy,"Made with 90% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with funky aromas of leafy underbrush, scorched earth, toasted oak and a whiff of barnyard.

US,"A pretty good price for a single-vineyard Chard from a great appellation. Unoaked, the wine is very crisp in acidity, with citrus, apricot and mineral flavors that finish dry and clean.",87,15.0,California,Carneros,Chardonnay,Kopriva
France,"At this stage, the wine is closed, just hinting at its rich, fruity future. It has good acidity and a touch of bitter almonds, but the real fruitiness is still to come. Wait until 2015.",88,18.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Blanc,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Roc de Minvielle

Italy,"Structured and elegant, this opens with aromas of blue flower, tilled earth, leather and a balsamic note. The multifaceted palate delivers wild cherry, raspberry, orange peel, menthol and cinnamon, while youthfully austere but fine tannins provide support.

Balanced by minerality and acid, the wine finishes clean and elegantly. Another win for Dr. Frank.",88,20.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Gewürztraminer,Dr. Konstantin Frank
US,"A very fine effort, with classic cassis and black cherry in the fruit core, but also offering interesting details of bark, earth and herb. The wine lingers, perhaps due to excellent natural acidity, and without overpowering the palate it keeps tantalizing it with nuances of moist earth and wet rock.",90,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Waterbrook
Italy,"Dense and hearty, this has subtle aromas of stewed prune, espresso and French oak. The brawny palate offers blackberry extract, licorice, ground pepper and the heat of evident alcohol alongside tightly packed, close-grained tannins that leave an astringent finish.

US,"Very fine and complex. This deeply flavored Pinot Noir is powerful, but it's also elegantly silky, which is the magic combination.

Pair it with creamy or cheesy dishes.",90,24.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese Grosso,Molino di Sant'Antimo
US,"The Pellegrini style seems to emphasize extraction. That's great-up to a point.

Australia,"Winemaker Nick Goldschmidt has turned out a Shiraz that seems a bit conflicted.

The peppery notes on the finish give it enough verve to pair with steaks or burgers.",87,25.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,Shiraz,Forefathers
France,"This structured wine still has a youthful fruity character, juicy with black currant flavors. The contrast is with the leaner, smoky side that comes from the tannins. It needs to age; drink from 2017.",86,25.0,Bordeaux,Médoc,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Ramafort

There's some phenolic bite in the finish, and a hint of plastic.",85,12.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling,Covey Run
US,"It is one of the mysteries of viticulture how a vineyard in the chilly lower Carneros, better suited for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, can consistently produce such a glorious Cabernet Sauvignon. The little knoll it grows on seems to be a well-drained banana belt. The '03, like its predecessors, is rich and balanced in black currant, cherry, milk chocolate and sweet herb flavors, and is soft enough for immediate drinking. But it should develop well for many years.",92,65.0,California,Carneros,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clos Pegase
Italy,"There's an interesting aromatic element here that recalls musky flower or scented candle. Beyond that, you'll get traditional Pinot Grigio aromas of citrus and stone fruit.

US,"Purple and tannic, with a grapey aroma and a suggestion of dusty earth. The most interesting of RiverAerie's pure varietals, perhaps because of its high-toned, slightly volatile mouthfeel. Berry/cherry fruit comes through sharply, then quickly fades into herbal tannins.",86,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Malbec,RiverAerie
US,"A splash of tart cherry introduces this charming Pinot Noir, which resemble a country wine from the nether reaches of Burgundy.

A great quaffer.",86,18.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Airlie

US,"Borra is going old-school here, making the wine nonvintage and putting 10% each of Syrah and Mourvedre into Petite Sirah.

Australia,"Captivating, with zesty lemon and wet stones on the nose, followed by a complex medley of citrus, passionfruit and carnations on the palate.

Spain,"A touch doughy on the nose, with prune and blackberry aromas that are neither pushy nor aggressive. The palate is ripe, rich and just forward enough, with blackberry, wild berry, coffee and fudge flavors.

US,"This ripe, lush Syrah boldly expresses itself with shiny, saturated colors and bright, spicy, assertive fruit.

France,"This may be from the exceptional vintage of 2003, but Château Margaux remains true to form. First and foremost, it is a refined, elegant wine, with complex layers of flavors. But, yes, the hot summer is there the dense, dry tannins, but somehow they seem to float through the wine rather than sitting heavily in the middle.

Spain,"This five-grape blend is based on Treixadura but also includes Albariño, Loureira, Lado and Torrontès. The grapes were picked well into October, so the richness and alcohol are up there.

Argentina,"Calling this big-boned brew potent may be understating things. This is brawny Tupungato Malbec in full armor.

Comfortable on the palate and well balanced overall.",90,29.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Malbec,Finca Sophenia

France,"Flinty and lean, with mineral and citrus aromas. An “oyster wine” in that it's ultra tart. Flavors of sour apple, lemon and pineapple will show best if it's served chilled.

Drink this full-bodied Côtes du Rhône over the next several years.",89,24.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône,Rhône-style Red Blend,La Bastide Saint Dominique
France,"This rather full and slightly fruity offering shows attractive plum and berry aromas and flavors.  The mouthfeel, though, is quite soft, verging on mushy, without an acid backbone to provide definition to the flavors and life to the palate feel.  Has a touch of class and a decent length; deserves a spine.",85,45.0,Champagne,Champagne,Champagne Blend,Lechère

France,"From a vintage known for its readily-approachable wines, this grand cru Saint-Emilion shows surprising structure. Some toasty oak frames delicate black-cherry fruit.

Spain,"Round up front, although not terribly fragrant. The nose shows only subtle berry and game aromas, with a hint of bacon. Very tannic, with a foundation of bitter chocolate and earth.

Italy,"Here's an oak-driven Sauvignon Blanc from the 2004 vintage with a thick layer of toast, nut and campfire that play a leading role and leave little room for the wine's natural fruit and floral tones. Those carpentry notes also dominate the mouthfeel and add a piquant touch of exotic spice on the close. That said, this white wine has held very well over the years.",87,55.0,Central Italy,Forlì,Sauvignon Blanc,Castelluccio
US,"Too young to enjoy now. The tannins and acids are such that they lock the wine down. The fruit tastes sharp and jammy, and the alcohol, even though it isn't high, sticks out.

US,"A worthy followup to the 2007, perhaps not as immediately flamboyant, but a major Pinot Noir to age in the cellar.

Australia,"De Bortoli's unique approach to harvest timing and extensive use of new oak leaves this wine seeming rather disjointed: coffee and cola notes dominate the tart, cranberryish fruit flavors.

But at this price, these are minor quibbles.",84,9.0,California,California,Merlot,CK Mondavi
Argentina,"The nose on this blend of Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet is leafy and a touch dilute, with basic cherry and berry notes.

Italy,"From Apulia, in the Italian heel, a blend of Negroamaro and Malvasia Rosso. Long a supermarket favorite, the brand has always been rustic and powerful, but flavorful and inexpensive.

Australia,"Mourvèdre—often called Mataro in Australia—isn't often seen on its own, but this is a solid example.

The wine delivers impenetrable density, extraction, black fruit, spice, berry preserves, licorice, asphalt, ground black pepper, cherry liqueur and crème de cassis.

France,"Lightly amylic-pear drop, resin, mineral, stone-fruit and peach-skin aromas dominate the youthful nose of this wine. Very clean and mineral-focused.

An unusual, compelling wine.",91,24.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,White Blend,Scubla
Spain,"Quite tannic and biting, but beyond those mouthfeel issues this affordable RDD has its positives. The bouquet of toast, mocha and coconut is alluring, and then the palate of dark-fruit flavors, while rock-hard, is masculine. But never does one escape the feel and balance shortcomings.

Australia,"For the past several years, Duval's Plexus has been remarkably consistent in quality. The only indication here that 2008 was a difficult vintage (because of the heat) is this wine's creamy immediacy, which suggests early consumption (now–2015).

Italy,"The Ceretto was surprisingly evolved for a 2006. A big, ripe, rich wine with flavors of pear, lychee and a hint of lime peel.

US,"The vineyard is in the warmest corner of the valley, almost into Dry Creek, and the wine in its youth is a bit heavy.

Spain,"Full, dark and dense, with blackberry, molasses and bacon on the nose. At first it seems modern and new-wave, but the palate isn't fat and overextracted; instead it's zesty, vibrant and deals pugnacious blackberry flavors topped with spice and chocolate.

Italy,"Nero Latino lacks harmony overall because of its rapid succession of unrelated aromas: Red apple is followed by mushroom, beets, strawberry, chocolate and smoke.

The finish is all about coffee, cardamom and five spice.",93,82.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem

The wine is supple but dense on the palate and would make an excellent companion to pork with glazed onions.",88,25.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,White Blend,Midolini
Italy,"Despite its very young age, this bright 30-30-40 blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon shows impressive sophistication and personality. Neutral oak is used to fine-tune the spice aromas and the wine shows intense flavors of blackberry, cherry, leather and pipe tobacco.",89,24.0,Tuscany,Bolgheri,Red Blend,Casa di Terra
Spain,"Consistency is a virtue in this business, and this wine tastes almost exactly like the highly recommended 2005. The nose blends green grass and golden fruits, while the palate is clean, intense and snappy. This is a wine that sings, and the interspersed notes of bell pepper, grapefruit and mineral are just right for Verdejo. Drink right away for maximum freshness.",90,11.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,Verdejo,Pedro Escudero
US,"Shows the purity of flavor and structure that Bonterra wines are famous for. Ultraclean and racy in acidity, this Chardonnay stars ripe varietal flavors of pineapples, oranges and limes. A touch of oak adds welcome richness.",88,14.0,California,Mendocino County,Chardonnay,Bonterra

France,"Ripe and creamy in texture, this is a pear and peach flavored wine. A touch of butteriness gives a rounded texture and a hint of vanilla. Drink this fruity wine from 2015.",86,32.0,Burgundy,Mercurey,Chardonnay,Château Philippe-le-Hardi
Australia,"Starts with scents of pear and melon, butter and spice, but takes on an ever-larger oak presence in the mouth, adding more and more wood spice and cedar. Not sure if this will ever completely integrate, so the best bet seems to be drinking earlier rather than later.",88,30.0,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,Chardonnay,Shaw and Smith
Italy,"This inky black blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot delivers a thick, impenetrable appearance with jammy notes of blackberry preserves and maraschino cherry. It presents chewy, succulent fruit but is not overdone or too heavy on the close.",87,24.0,Veneto,Veneto,Red Blend,Cescon Italo Storia e Vini
US,"Rhubarb, cola and pencil shavings emerge from the glass on this appellation blend from the longtime Santa Rosa Road winery, today owned by the Terlato family. Deeply earthy aromas of beet juice, root beer and dried berries arise on the palate, showing the region's typical blend of soil minerality and dark fruit.",89,42.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Noir,Sanford
France,"One of the flagship wines of Louis Latour, this has great weight, richness and ripe yellow fruits, all surrounded by wood and citrus flavors. A sense of mineral in the texture adds complexity, while the firm structure needs to age. Drink from 2018.",94,140.0,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,Chardonnay,Louis Latour
Spain,"Cherry, earth and leather are nice opening notes, while some charred oak adds masculinity and depth. Almost syrupy in the mouth, with plenty of black cherry and chocolate to satisfy those with a sweet tooth. Exhibits nice core qualities. Imported by Five Star Imports.",88,13.0,Catalonia,Priorat,Red Blend,Sangenís I Vaqué
US,"What went wrong in the making of this wine was excessive sugar. It's so sweet, it's off-dry, a serious flaw in a table wine, and a disservice to consumers who expect a Sauvignon Blanc to be dry.",80,18.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Gann
France,"Darkly tannic, Tannat-dominated wine. The structure is formidable, its rich fruit layered with the dry spice, fruit cake flavor and a powerful texture. Think of this wine with a stew, but also age for a few years.",90,16.0,Southwest France,Madiran,Tannat,Producteurs Plaimont
Argentina,"Consistently a very good Cabernet, with big, broad roasted aromas backing solid black fruit. The palate is rich, rugged and powerful, with mildly baked plum and blackberry flavors. Oak and vanilla show up on the finish, which is round and the slightest bit herbal. Drink now through 2012.",89,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Cabernet Sauvignon,BenMarco
US,"Light and crisp, this wine offers the freshness of orange rind and lemon, both aromatically and on the palate. It's refreshing and not overdone.",88,17.0,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay,Dominican Oaks
US,"From a dependable producer, a rich, fragrant wine that straddles a nice balance between overt fruitiness and subtle, earthy complexities. The fruits veer toward blackberries, with hints of coffee bean and light oak, and the tannins are modulated and lush. It's drinkable now and probably not a long-term ager.",88,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Merlot,Burgess
US,"Glimpses of sunny yellow peach and apple peek through layers of heady spice, vanilla and toast in this brisk but oaky Chardonnay. It's polished but spry, revitalized by a spray of zesty acidity through the midpalate and finish. Drink now through 2020.",87,15.0,New York,Seneca Lake,Chardonnay,Fox Run
US,"A big, juicy, fruit-bomb of a rosé, this Knight's Gambit from Erath mixes flavors of rosewater, watermelon, strawberries and cocoa in a big, broad, forward, palate-pleasing wine. The pretty pink color is from skin contact with the Pinot Gris—no red wine was added.",88,22.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Pinot Gris,Erath
US,"This vineyard-designate, made using fruit from what is arguably the best AVA in Oregon, is crisp, spicy, peppery and herbal. The tight red fruit shows good concentration, with nicely balanced barrel notes of light chocolate and coffee.",90,32.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Pinot Noir,Westrey
Spain,"Light and basic Macabeo with melon and other sweet, mellow aromas. The palate is a bit flat in feel but otherwise there's nothing wrong. Tastes of light citrus, kiwi and white grapes. Chalky and slightly stony on the finish.",86,10.0,Levante,Yecla,Macabeo,La Purísima
US,"Rich as can be, but oak dominates, giving the wine buttered toast and caramelized vanilla flavors, and you'll even find notes of buttered popcorn. Although there's lovely pineapple and citron fruit and fine Carneros acidity, this Chardonnay tastes overly manipulated.",87,55.0,California,Carneros,Chardonnay,Patz & Hall
US,"A little thin, but a really nice wine. Likeable for its upfront acidity and minerality, and flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, green apples and honey. The slightly sweet finish makes it a nice partner for Chinese and Vietnamese fare.",85,10.0,California,Monterey County,Riesling,Castle Rock
Italy,Preda is a solid and dense expression of Barolo with oak-related notes of vanilla and spice that need a few more years to integrate fully. The quality of the fruit is evident and with 10 more years of cellar aging all those elegant Nebbiolo aromas of licorice and white truffle should shine through.,92,98.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Cascina Adelaide
US,"Pungent notes of cranberry and pruny oak mark this wine, with tannins that are a bit tough and slightly out of balance.",83,20.0,California,North Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Manifesto!
US,"Another successful Cabernet from Amici, who turns to this esteemed vineyard for sourcing. It shows real pedigree and finesse, and it's instantly appealing for its soft tannins and complex cherry, red currant, cocoa and spice flavors. Yes, it's expensive, but it's Amici's best Cabernet of the vintage, and this is as upscale as Napa Cabernet gets.",95,125.0,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon,Amici
Australia,"Winemaker Noel Heidenreich's Shiraz is compelling, not overwhelming, with some vanilla flavors framing juicy red plum and raspberry fruit. It's pleasing and textured, and gives the same impression on the nose: spice, curry, moist clay, red fruit. Very appealing overall, tiptoeing out on the finish with soft tannins. Imported by The Australian Wine Connection.",90,34.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,Shiraz,Old School
Italy,"This well-priced Merlot has jammy aromas of cherry and blackberry folded within spice and leather. The wine is raw, chewy and succulent on the close.",84,10.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,Merlot,Lagaria
Italy,"The packaging stands out with its tiny grape cutting that's tied to the bottle's neck. This is a bright wine that's redolent of lemon soda, chalky candy (like Pez) and apricot.",85,17.0,Central Italy,Colline Pescaresi,Pinot Grigio,Cantina Zaccagnini
France,"A voluptuous blockbuster in the style we are becoming accustomed to from über-consultant Michel Rolland: big, deeply fruited (black cherries) and plush, with elegantly etched spice shadings from new oak. The tannins are supple but substantial; it should age for a long time. Made entirely from old-vine Malbec and named after the pigeon coop in the Château's courtyard.",93,60.0,Southwest France,Cahors,Malbec,Château Lagrézette
US,"The structure on this wine is just fine, with crisp, coastal acidity and low alcohol making for a clean, well-balanced Chard. Its weakness is in the thinness of flavor. The wine is watery, with mere traces of citrus fruits and peaches.",82,13.0,California,California,Chardonnay,Congress Springs
Australia,"Pronto red is 77% Grenache, with the remainder a blend of Touriga Nacional (11%), Syrah (7%) and Monastrell (5%). It starts off with leather and spice, then folds in cherries and licorice. It's full-bodied, round and slightly warm, with a supple, spice-driven finish. Drink now-2015.",90,69.0,South Australia,Adelaide,Red Blend,S.C. Pannell
France,"96–98. Barrel sample. The first vintage from a newly-constructed cellar, this is a beautiful wine, with glorious Merlot flavors. It's full of spice and dense with velvet tannins. The wine has great opulence and its fruit is well integrated into the structure.",97,24.0,Bordeaux,Pomerol,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pétrus
Spain,Jammy aromas of blackberry and cassis start out gaseous and muddled but find their way with airing. This feels wide and low on zest. Flavors of prune and stewed berry end with toasty oak but also heavy ripe prune and berry flavors. Drink now.,88,17.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,Mencía,Dominio de Tares
Italy,"This Soave Classico opens with intense aromas of banana, pear, pineapple and ripe melon. The aromas are on the mature and heavy side, but the wine does deliver more freshness in the mouth. Drink now.",86,24.0,Veneto,Soave Classico,Garganega,Domìni Veneti
US,"Here's a soft, fruity and sweet Cabernet, rich and spicy in raspberry, cherry and blackberry jam. Lots of new oak adds smoky vanilla and caramel notes. It's delicious, but pretty direct, lacking some complexity and structure.",87,70.0,California,Napa Valley,Red Blend,Bell
US,"The tannins are hard and strong. It's not undrinkable, but it is hard to enjoy, despite a solid core of black currants and cassis liqueur. The finish is bone dry and astringent. Drink now.",86,29.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Triumph Cellars
US,"Tasted just at its official release, this very young Syrah was not in full form. The barrel scents and flavors were not integrated, and the fruit was standard red wine fare. The rather high (15%) alcohol brings neither ripeness nor depth, and the roasted coffee flavors from the barrels quickly take over the finish.",85,19.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah,DaMa
US,"With burgers, dogs and the like, this is a nice red wine, gutsy and full-bodied, with cherry and blackberry flavors and the acidity to stand up to ketchup.",84,9.0,California,California,Shiraz,Fetzer

France,"At this stage, the wine is closed up, the fruit quite tight. But it is extremely rich, the potential from the spice, broad white fruits and intense minerality all promising good aging.",94,145.0,Burgundy,Puligny-Montrachet,Chardonnay,Domaine Leflaive
Spain,"Muga has crafted a steely, no-fat Viura (with 10% Malvasia), despite the wine being fermented in barrel. The nose is clean and passive, while the palate is crisp and tight but largely neutral in its delivery of apple and lemon flavors. From a cool vintage, this wine is like kissing the razor's edge. Good stuff but limited in what it has in store.",87,17.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Viura,Muga
US,"Give credit to cool Monterey for yielding a wine that's this dry, with acidic long hangtime fruit. It's this type of PG that has made the variety an overnight success. The acids perk up the palate, making the pineapple, peach, fig and wildflower flavors bright and tangy.",87,14.0,California,Monterey,Pinot Grigio,Maddalena
France,"A stunning Minervois red composed of 50% Syrah, 30% Grenache, 10% Mourvèdre and 10% Carignan. Garrigue definitely takes center stage on the nose via thyme and lavender, with a strong black cherry and raspberry backbone. A lush, satiny texture with dusty tannins and a rich mocha-infused finish.",91,25.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Minervois,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine Sainte Léocadie
US,"One of the palest, lightest Pinots out there; the cold vintage seems to have taken its toll, making the wine low in alcohol and delicately flavored in sour cherry candy, orange zest and flat cola. Drink up.",87,45.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Pinot Noir,Ghostwriter
Italy,"Mature notes of raspberry and blueberry are followed by toasted almond and distant notes of exotic spice. This blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon shows harmony and balance between modern oak-related elements and natural fruit. It closes with soft, smooth cherry flavors.",88,24.0,Tuscany,Val di Cornia Suvereto,Red Blend,Monterufoli
Australia,"Starts off dark and a bit brooding, with aromas of plum, espresso and black olive, but shows hints of brighter fruit elements on the palate. Mouthfilling but dry on the finish, this is still very young; decant if serving now, or try 2013-2020.",90,29.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,Shiraz-Viognier,D'Arenberg
Spain,"This Rioja rose displays a full bouquet of rose petal, spice and the slightly meaty element that Tempranillo so often shows. No White Zinfandel, this is a fairly lean and dry wine with spicy notes, a decent match for hors d'oeuvres or light meals.",84,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Rosé,Bodegas Faustino
Italy,"Enhanced with polished notes of toasted nut and vanilla (the wine sees 12 month of barrique) this is a more austere Pinot Nero with delicate nuances of spice, blue fruit and white mushroom. The fruit comes from a high-density vineyard planted in 1991 with clay and rocky soils.",89,40.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,Pinot Nero,Alois Lageder
Italy,"This is a beautifully executed, amber-colored vin santo with pristine notes of dried fruit, honey, molasses and caramel. It doesn't have any of those resin-driven, smoky notes that you sometimes find and is instead very harmonious and clean in the mouth. It imparts a luscious, velvety feel that ends sweet and tart.",93,55.0,Tuscany,Vin Santo del Chianti,White Blend,Fattoria Petrolo

US,"This is easily the greatest of Foxen's new Chardonnays. It show the dryness and crisp acidity of the other bottlings, but is enormously rich and complex in oak-inspired pineapple, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and mineral flavors. Decant for a while to let it mellow, and it should develop bottle complexity through 2014.",94,32.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay,Foxen
Italy,"Impressive complexity on the nose from layers of red fruit and barnyard as well as some dusty notes. Cherry and raspberry fruit vie with stringy tannins in the mouth. Unlike many Dolcettos, this one will benefit from a few years bottle age.",87,23.0,Piedmont,Dolcetto di Dogliani,Dolcetto,Poderi Luigi Einaudi
US,"Shows the creamy texture of Chardonnay, with the sweet-and-sour pineapple flavor of a Chinese food sauce.",82,7.0,California,California,Chardonnay,Barefoot
US,"Exorbitantly fruity, almost undrinkable because it's so strong in blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa. The fruit strength seems to accentuate the smoky oak. But it's balanced in terms of acidity, tannins and dryness. Desperately needs a few years. Better after 2012.",90,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Selene

Argentina,"The color is deep purple, the nose dense, alluring and hinting at mint, shoe polish, violet and blackberry. Flavors are pure, modestly oaky and deep in terms of wild berry, coffee and chocolate.",92,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Bonarda,Durigutti
Spain,"Simple but steady and composed. This is throwback-style Rioja crianza, meaning it's moderately oaked and not very fat or expressive. Strawberry and cherry flavors run the show, and the mouthfeel is fresh. More innocuous than detailed, which means it'll do fine by-the-glass.",85,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo Blend,Berberana
France,"87-89 Barrel sample. Sweet blackcurrant, and a gentle tannins. The structure is obviously dense, but the richness hides it to give a velvet wine.",88,24.0,Bordeaux,Lalande de Pomerol,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Bertineau Saint-Vincent
US,"Deeply flavored and impressive, this intensely young, Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend hails from Mount Veeder. It has all the hallmarks of a wine that needs time in the cellar. The sweetly extracted black currant and licorice fruit is massive, and so is the cedary oak, which is 80% new French, while considerable mountain tannins give a hard, astringent mouthfeel. Solidly in the modern Napa style, this opulent wine should improve over the next six years, at least.",94,56.0,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ramian

Spain,"Solid as a rock, with earthy berry and mild herbal aromas. The palate is firm and a touch angular, with sweet raisin, blackberry, candy and chocolate flavors.

Italy,"Mildly baked on the nose, with aromas of fired clay, roast plum and fresh tomato. It maintains a heavy, roasted personality through the palate, which is carried by plum and raspberry, all the way to the savory finish. Registers as a wide, tannic red with bulk.",87,23.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,Sangiovese,Marchesi Cattaneo di Belforte
Argentina,"Raspberry, plum and cherry aromas become more thin, cheesy and leathery with time. The palate is hard and narrow, with sheer flavors of generic raspberry and plum. Clacky and rough feeling on the finish.",83,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Cabernet Sauvignon,Don Manuel Villafañe
Italy,"Ripe and plump, this is a generous Ripasso with a vibrant color and pristine aromas of red cherry, spice, dried apple and current berry.

The concentration is impressive, as are the barrel flavors on the finish. Vanilla, coconut, caramel and lightly buttered almonds all contribute to the nuanced detail.",92,25.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Viognier,Cristom
US,"Shows the delicacy and finesse of the finest Pinot Noirs of this vintage, and is a solid expression of this always fine bottling, although lacking a shade of the opulence of the '04.

France,"Produced by the major négociant Castel, this juicy, fruity wine is proving to be drinkable already. Soft, with a black currant flavor, it has fine acids and spicy, toasty touches on the finish.",86,24.0,Bordeaux,Médoc,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Tour Prignac
France,Heavy bottles and heavy extract seem to go together; proving the point is this wine. Heavy toast dominates the berry fruit. The normal wine from Cheval Noir is much more attractive.,85,40.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Mähler-Besse
Italy,"Here's a light and refreshing Rosso di Montalcino with sharp notes of berry, cherry, wet earth and violets. You'll also get some distant mineral tones that add dimension and personality. Pair this easy-drinking wine with your favorite home-cooked pasta dishes.",86,24.0,Tuscany,Rosso di Montalcino,Sangiovese Grosso,Sesti
Spain,"Tropical fruit, passion fruit and lime aromas are a bit sweaty and suggestive of pine resin. This is low on spine and verve, meaning it's a touch flat and flabby. Briny nectarine and tarragon flavors finish with green notes of scallion and lime.",85,15.0,Northern Spain,Rueda,Verdejo,Emina
US,"There's an earthy note of cola that grounds the ripe cherry and pomegranate fruit, giving it depth and complexity. Made from one of the vineyards closest to the coast, this wine provides plenty of Pinot character. Thick tannins and vital acidity suggest aging until at least 2013.",92,42.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Pinot Noir,Mistress
France,"While there is definitely some intensity of bitter cherry fruit, there is also a stalky edge to this wine that comes from tart, dry tannins. The finishing acidity gives some freshness, but this remains on the edge of green. Screwcap. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",84,27.0,Burgundy,Bourgogne,Pinot Noir,Bertrand Ambroise
US,"The nose on this bright red blend from Sanders Ridge is spicy and smoky with abundant red fruit, leather and tobacco. The cheery red fruits carry through on the palate as well with a plush, but pleasant demeanor.

US,"Sweaty and pruney in the nose, this hot and disjointed wine could be almost any red grape; there's no varietal character. It's volatile and thins out quickly, leaving green tannins in the back of the mouth.",82,32.0,Oregon,Columbia Valley (OR),Syrah,Cathedral Ridge
US,"Light and elegant, this polished Pinot is for early drinking. Bone dry and crisply acidic, the wine has the silky delicacy of the variety, with cherry, raspberry, tea, rose petal, cola and woodspice flavors, and a slightly astringent finish of finely ground tannins.",90,31.0,California,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"This is a lighter style of the variety from a stellar vineyard, a crisp take on red cherry, dried cranberry and pomegranate that's deliciously balanced and sublime. A subtle suggestion of oak and spice peeks out on the lengthy finish, making for a complete, extremely quaffable wine.",94,56.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Papapietro Perry

Spain,"Mature mealy apricot aromas lead to a spent palate with unfocused cidery flavors that taste old and demanding. This finishes heavy, pulpy and without much point or pleasure. Albariño is meant to be fresh and friendly, but this is neither.",83,20.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,Albariño,Fillaboa
France,"A solid and chunky wine, this balances a rich structure with ripe, rounded fruit. Acidity cuts through the complex texture to give a juicy, fragrant feel. It's worth aging another year.",91,24.0,Beaujolais,Morgon,Gamay,Georges Duboeuf

France,"With 39% Petit Verdot, this is a rarity in Bordeaux. It is certainly reflected in the dark color of the wine. It has spice and a densely concentrated structure, firm and chunky.

Italy,"This standout Amarone boasts elegant mineral tones of wet river stone and crushed granite, which are followed by softer layers of ripe fruit and spice.

Italy,"This is an attractive 50-50 blend of Cab and Syrah with thick, lush notes of sweet vanilla, black pepper and ripe cherry.

Spain,"Briny, leesy aromas are funky and sweaty, not clean and lean like most Txakoli. Snappy, citric and decidedly not spritzy, this tastes of lemon, underripe nectarine and tart green apple. A cleansing seltzer-like finish is the closing act.",85,20.0,Northern Spain,Getariako Txakolina,Hondarrabi Zuri,Gaintza
France,"Citrus and herb characteristics show strongly in this full-bodied wine. They are enhanced by light wood flavors that smooth out the acidity. The result is a full, rich wine that could age. Drink from 2015.",91,24.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Blanc,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Maison Noble
Italy,"This well-priced Nero d'Avola makes for a fresh and informal wine that could pair nicely next to pork chops or pasta with tomato and ground veal sauce. The wine shows bright berry aromas with a chewy, succulent mouthfeel.",86,12.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,Nero d'Avola,Viticultori Associati Canicatti
US,"Nearly five years after it was made, this Syrah remains dark and tannic, but the fruit is starting to make the magical transition from primary to secondary. It's picking up dried blackberry, dessicated blueberry and beef jerky flavors that finish long and spicy. Yet it still has youthful acidity and freshness. This will be a fun wine to follow over the next five years.",92,25.0,California,Russian River Valley,Syrah,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"This best-of-barrels blend shows the powerful tannins and dryness that mark all of Turnbull's 2009 Cabernets. It's a huge wine, powerful and concentrated in blackberries, black currants and sweet dark chocolate, with notes of spices on the long, dry finish. Drink it now, with the best beef entrée you can find. It should slowly develop bottle-age characteristics over the next 8–10 years, at a minimum.",95,100.0,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon,Turnbull
US,"Dusty mineral and earth tones lend a savory feel to delicate cherry and red-plum flavors in this pale pink rosé. Bright, fresh raspberry-lemonade acidity bristles on the palate.",84,13.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Rosé,Knapp
US,"Good, dry and crisp, if a little simple, with apricot, citrus and vanilla flavors. There's a touch of green unripeness that detracts, but it's a pretty nice wine.",86,20.0,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Gris,Horse & Plow
US,"Coming from such a cool climate, this Cab isn't as opulent or ripe as, say, Napa. There's a wintergreen mint note alongside the sweet red cherry and black raspberry flavors, and a lightly elegant weight. It's a different kind of Cab, but a dry, good one, and very friendly with food.",87,35.0,California,San Luis Obispo County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wildwood
US,"Pretty good for the price. Dry and fruity, with polished cherry and cassis flavors. Turns a little harsh and minty, but easy to like with pizza, burgers, enchiladas.",85,12.0,California,California,Red Blend,Stephen Vincent
US,"A helluva Cabernet. Extraordinarily rich and opulent in blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, with elaborate oak, yet completely dry, and given balance by firm, hard tannins and a fine cut of acidity. Really impressive now, after decanting, and should develop over the next six years, at the very least.",94,110.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Nice
Spain,"Smells like compost, and never does that earthy, stenchiness lift. The palate is thick and muddled, with wan, dry, buttery raspberry flavors that lack direction. Finishes dry and bland, without much structure.",82,20.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Tempranillo,Convento Oreja
Australia,"Hints at honey, apple and citrus on the nose, then delivers all of those notes minus the implied sweetness and coupled with high acid levels. Although this is in a nice place now as an apéritif or with oysters, it should hold nicely for at least 5–7 years, adding richness and versatility as it ages.",90,17.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,Riesling,Pewsey Vale
US,"Aged in neutral oak barrels with malolactic fermentation, this medium yellow-colored wine brings notes of wheat cereal, peach and lees. It's dry and broad in feel with tart acidity, seeming slightly advanced for its age.",87,16.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Pinot Gris,River's Edge
Italy,"A pure expression of the rare Mondeuse grape, L'Ardenza opens with bold concentration and soft layers of cherry and plush black fruit. The wine is lush and rich, with an easy finish.",89,48.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,Mondeuse,Cottanera
Spain,"This wine is about as raisiny as it gets while still holding onto a sense of balance. Aromas of stewed berry fruits, prune and carob lead to a grabby, lemony tasting palate with raisin, vanilla and sweet tobacco on the finish.",83,23.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Red Blend,Bodegas Corral
Italy,"Valentina Cubi is a quality Amarone producer to look out for especially if you like big and brawny wines with skyscraping intensity. A beautiful Bordeaux-inspired cellar and barrique regimen has recently been installed and the producer is entering the market with four vintages at once. The 2001 is the youngest and boasts nutty spice, poached apple and pure integrity of fruit with firm tannins and long cherry flavors on the finish.",93,40.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Valentina Cubi
France,"Firm and rich wine, with the black fruits melding well with the tannins. It has plenty of structure, but that is still at a youthful stage. The final acidity adds freshness and brings in berry fruits.",89,24.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Grand Corbin
US,"This is the inaugural vintage of what is intended to be the flagship wine in the Milbrandt portfolio. It has rather light fruit flavors of mixed red berries and currants, a little spice and some toasty accents from barrel aging. Decanting may help to flesh it out.",89,55.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Red Blend,Milbrandt
US,"Hogue's low-cost red is a roughly 50/50 blend, with surprising ripeness and sweetness for a wine in this price range. There's just a bit of the bell pepper quality of inexpensive Washington Cabernet, but not enough to be off-putting. The wine is reasonably ripe, full and well-balanced, with fruit, acids and tannins in equal proportion.",85,10.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Hogue
US,"Strong wood smoke and grilled meat aromas lead to equally assertive oak and dried herb flavors, giving this wine extreme personality. It has medium body and rather soft tannins and texture to balance.",86,12.0,California,Lodi,Cabernet Franc,Ironstone
France,"Fruity and fresh, this tastes off dry. There is a touch of yeastiness that blows off, leaving wild strawberry and citrus flavors, with a soft, creamy finish.",84,18.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Rosé,Rosé,Château de Sours
Italy,"Floral aromas are more defined than the fruity ones. Still, they leave room for attractive almond skin, flint and eucalyptus accents. Simple and lightweight in the mouth, with a sour note on the finish. Imported by Moët Hennessy USA.",85,12.0,Northeastern Italy,Delle Venezie,Pinot Grigio,Esperto
US,"Here's a nice, clean, elegantly structured 100% Sauvignon Blanc. It has flavors of oranges, grapefruits and peaches. Although there's no new oak on it, the notes of sweet vanilla and buttered toast are strong.",87,34.0,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Alpha Omega
US,"A lovely, everyday drinking Sauvignon Blanc. It's zesty in acidity, with mouth-cleansing flavors of lemons, limes and oranges. Finishes a little sweet, but not too much. A delight for late afternoon cocktails with little munchies, like puff pastry mushrooms.",87,14.0,California,Paso Robles,Sauvignon Blanc,Maddalena
Italy,"A well-balanced and nicely aged Amarone from the hot 2003 vintage; shows aromas of mature fruit offset nicely by spice, molasses and toasted nut. It's a smooth, thick wine with chewy density and a surprising touch of crisp freshness on the close.",90,99.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Trabucchi d'Illasi
US,"Delicious in pastry-filling raspberry and cherry flavors, with a baked brown sugar richness and exotic touches of vanilla, cinnamon, anise and toast. Dazzles with a direct hit to the palate; is soft and dry. But it has a certain surface one dimensionality. Seems at its best now–2013.",88,85.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Paul Hobbs
Spain,"Thick and pasty smelling, this has roasted berry scents that are slightly leathery. It's scratchy and mildly astringent on the palate, tasting minty and dry, with a mild fruit content. The finish is chunky and resiny.",84,13.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Tempranillo,Mano A Mano
Spain,"Golden-brown in color, this has heady aromas of cola, nut, nutmeg, root beer and caramel. It feels full, slightly rich and properly cut, with coffee, toffee, chocolate and honey flavors. A balanced but elevated dessert-style Sherry that gets it right.",90,15.0,Andalucia,Jerez,Sherry,Bodegas Dios Baco S.L.
Spain,"A pretty good Tempranillo-Garnacha blend with simple but fresh berry and plum aromas. The palate has snap but no overt acidic bite, while flavors of cherry and berry are slightly herbal and end with a mild buttery accent. A touch flimsy but keeps it together.",85,13.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,Tempranillo-Garnacha,Red Guitar
US,"For those looking for a leaner, earthier but still-stylish Cabernet, this is the ticket. It's very dry, with soft Alexander Valley tannins and flavors of blackberries, cherries and herbs. This elegant young wine could easily develop fascinating bottle complexities over the next 8–10 years.",90,38.0,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Stuhlmuller Vineyards
US,"Very deep and dense in the mouth, showing tough tannins and an immature fruit character that sorely needs aging. This is one for the cellar. Needs a few more years to come around and allow the cherries, blackberries and currants to emerge and meld with the oak. Best 2011–2015.",92,60.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Noir,Sanford
Spain,"A greeting of toasted nuts and toffee is lifted and sweet, and the palate is quite sweet, with orange marmalade and cinnamon-infused syrup flavors. The finish teeters on cloying as it packs a sweet punch, but there's enough acidity to keep it moving along. Best if you like sweet Sherry.",87,13.0,Andalucia,Jerez,Sherry,Pedro Romero
Italy,"A blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Merlot, this is a soft and lush red wine, with pretty aromas of cherry, blackberry, dried herb, spice and bitter chocolate. It has a smooth texture that's backed by firm, enduring structure.",90,31.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,Red Blend,Tenuta H.Lentsch
Argentina,"Smells sweet and gummy, like a plum-flavored sucking candy or a piece of grape bubblegum. The palate is a bit punishing and hard, while wild blackberry, acidity and finishing oak make up the flavors. Lively but untamed.",84,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Bonarda,Caligiore
US,"The winery's reserve-style Pinot Noir is based on concentration and power, not immediate appeal. It's a heavy, richly tannic wine, with roasted oak, cherry, grilled meat, anise and cinnamon spice flavors, almost as full-bodied as a Syrah. Try sometime in 2011.",87,65.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir,Paraiso Vineyards
Italy,"Soft and round with seductive notes of cherry, vanilla and gianduja (chocolate with hazelnuts), this is a big, powerful New World Barolo that puts on a pretty show. Background notes of licorice root and exotic spice add to the wine's naturally thick, dense feel. Drink it with mild lamb curries after 2015.",92,43.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Pe're Alessandro
US,"Ed Sbragia is making some of the most interesting single-vineyard Cabernets in California. This one, from Howell Mountain, shows the density and power that typify all his wines. Although it's thoroughly dry, it tastes almost sweet in grilled blackberry marmalade flavors, balanced with good acidity and wonderfully fine tannins. Feels like it has the capacity to age for decades.",95,75.0,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sbragia
Italy,"Enticing blue flower, rose, new leather and graphite scents lead the nose. The vibrant if rather slender palate offers tart cherry, chopped herb and a saline note, framed by firm, fine-grained tannins.",89,26.0,Tuscany,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,Sangiovese,Folonari
Italy,"Here's a straightforward but elegant expression of Nebbiolo that ages two years in oak to secure aromas of spice, cola, root beer and leather behind fruity tones of dried blueberries and currants. Pair this wine with lamb chops or pork roll marinated in fresh garden herbs.",89,38.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Vinchio-Vaglio Serra
US,"Bergström's lineup of Pinot Noir begins where many other wineries finish. This complex, earthy wine shows its fair share of herb and even a hint of stem, but those are offset by crisp, well-defined flavors of cranberry, cherry and spice. A fine example of this winery's house style.",90,42.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Bergström
Spain,"Initial aromas are squarely in the bell pepper/jalapeño mode, and later moss and earth enter the picture. The palate is basic, a bit acidic, and saucy, with herbal red-fruit flavors and a finish of tomato and basil. Struggles a little, but solid in a “country” sort of way. The blend is Tempranillo, Garnacha, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.",84,40.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,Red Blend,Bodegas Alconde
US,"Gorgeous rose petal, spice and stone-fruit aromas waft from this intensely aromatic wine. It's juicy on the palate with sweet lychee flavor but balanced with elegant tea tones. Round and rich in feel with powerful body and alcohol, it finishes with a bristle of astringency.",89,18.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Gewürztraminer,Sheldrake Point
Italy,"The juicy berry fruit on the nose carries a green herb element. While smooth in texture, the black cherry flavors of the palate seem a touch sharp and underripe. A touch of leather and caramel picks up the finish.",84,7.0,Tuscany,Chianti,Sangiovese,VinArte
France,"The Quarts de Chaume, the four fingers of land that rise above the Layon Valley, are one of the pinnacles of sweet wines in the Loire. Showing botrytis and layers of dryness over the honey and peach jelly flavors, but also has great freshness. The aftertaste just lasts.",92,152.0,Loire Valley,Quarts de Chaume,Chenin Blanc,Domaine Jo Pithon
France,"Produced by consultant Pascal Chatonnet, this is basic Saint-Emilion with attitude. Spicy new wood, rich, bitter chocolate flavors and superripe berry fruits are kept in order by the acidity and the dense core of dry tannins.",89,24.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château l'Archange
US,"Tastes like harvest in Hawaii. Toasted marshmallow, coconut and sunny tropical fruit notes hula on the opulent nose. A medium-weight palate of rich and warm, very comfortable flavors—apple cider, spice and earth—follows. A tangy, spicy finish makes you wish it were a touch longer.",89,40.0,California,Guenoc Valley,Chardonnay,Guenoc
US,"Light and tart, this brings cranberry and pepper flavors, which lead into a swift, sharp, tannic finish.",85,12.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Syrah,Willow Crest

US,"Fruity, with scads of pineapple, green apple, mango and vanilla cream flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. It's made in the popular style, at a popular price.",85,11.0,California,Carneros,Chardonnay,A By Acacia
US,"Very tight now, with minerally, yeasty flavors of lees and unintegrated smoky new oak. High acidity adds to the impression of austerity. Difficult to appreciate in its infancy, but this elegant, layered, complex Chard should begin to blossom after 2008 and hold for several years.",89,26.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay,Pessagno
Spain,"Rooty initial aromas veer toward animal and stalky berry fruits as this unfolds. Raw, hard and leathery in feel, this turns out to be low on ripeness as leafy, stalky flavors take over before ending salty, with firm tannins.",83,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo,La Cuna de la Poesia
Italy,"Here's an interesting Cabernet Franc-Merlot blend that boasts cooler, green aromas of cut grass, dill, bell pepper and small forest berries. The intensity of the flavors is good and graceful, without ever seeming heavy.",88,28.0,Southern Italy,Puglia,Red Blend,Alberto Longo
France,"Relatively tight and closed up at this stage, this wine is all about freshness, poised but rich fruit and a structure that suggests long-term development. The wood is quite prominent, overshadowing what will be delicious yellow-fruit flavors. Come back to this wine in 5 years time—it will be magnificent.",94,110.0,Burgundy,Meursault,Chardonnay,Pierre Morey
Argentina,"For a sense of class, elevation and style that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, this blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon is very much worth a go. It's versatile and stocky, but it's no fruit-only lug. That said, expect saturated berry flavors, herbal hints, baked notes and firm tannins. Masculine but approachable. Drink now through 2011.",90,21.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodegas Caro
France,"This is a ripe wine, full of apple and apricot fruit with a strong citrus line. A touch of minerality adds tangy texture and gives this rich wine plenty of life and freshness. Drink from 2015.",89,31.0,Burgundy,Pouilly-Fuissé,Chardonnay,Domaine Vincent Girardin
France,"Very soft and unfocused, this is in a full style, flavored with pink grapefruit and sweet lime. But it feels heavy in the mouth, obviously working better with food, but also showing signs of the sugar in the dosage.",83,68.0,Champagne,Champagne,Champagne Blend,Canard-Duchêne
France,"Ammonites are the fossils found in the chalk soil of Sancerre. This wine certainly shows the right mineral texture, very crisp and tight. It's full of citrus, zesty orange and apple skins. It needs to develop, wait until 2015.",91,35.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Matthias et Emile Roblin
Spain,"Big, smoky and concentrated on the nose, this has a ton of black fruit and char notes. This is mouth-filling, deep and powerful stuff, with a potent mash of baked blackberry, molasses and barbecue sauce filling in the flavor profile. It finishes long and roasted, with savory oak and saucy spice flavors. A blend of 85% Garnacha and 15% Monastrell.",89,16.0,Central Spain,Almansa,Garnacha-Monastrell,Atalaya
US,"A smooth, spicy Syrah to drink now. It has a leathery, gamy edge to the blackberries and black cherries, and finishes sweet in fruity essence.",86,13.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Syrah,Cameron Hughes
US,"Oregon Chardonnay in the low 12% alcohol range is well out of the ordinary, but it reflects the vintage conditions in 2010. This is a wine for acid lovers, with very tart green-apple fruit and a bit of spice.",85,22.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,Amalie Robert
US,"Rustic and sharp-edged in the mouth, with jagged tannins and acids, this Zin has a mixture of raisiny, just right, peppery, green fruit flavors. It finishes dry and astringent.",82,12.0,California,California,Zinfandel,Blackstone
US,"Sweet and sugary in pineapple, lime and green apple flavors, this Chardonnay has a strong overlay of sweet oak. Everything is too much. It lacks subtlely and complexity.",84,30.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Chardonnay,Petroni
US,"This fresh-tasting Syrah is loaded with boysenberry and black cherry fruit, then heads into darker flavors of black olive and coffee. There is a hint of leather, but not too much; it gives the wine a bit of a southern Rhône flavor.",87,23.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Syrah,Whidbey Island Winery
US,"Pressed apple and pear notes are accented with penetrating layers of smoke, nuts and clove on this full-bodied Chardonnay. Tart lemon acidity lends freshness to the midpalate and into a spry finish.",85,17.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay,Keuka Spring

France,"Peach and lemon combine in this superripe Chablis. Reflecting the warm vintage, the wine is soft, laced with lime juice acidity and hinting at vanilla and thyme. Round and warm, it is not typical Chablis, much more akin to a Meursault.",88,42.0,Burgundy,Chablis,Chardonnay,Labouré-Roi
Italy,"There's a pungent note here of overripe fruit or mature strawberry that takes away from the overall harmony and elegance of the wine. Instead, this is a workhorse Merlot with soft, chewy tannins and a thick mouthfeel that could match lamb in spinach curry sauce.",85,8.0,Central Italy,Terre di Chieti,Merlot,Spinelli
US,"I like this wine for its appealing softness and overall lusciousness. It's Paso at its red-wine best, showing cherry and cassis flavors balanced by a rich earthiness. It's totally dry, but so sweet in fruit, it's irresistible. Super value.",89,10.0,California,Paso Robles,Merlot,Grayson
US,"Expensive, yes, but this is a wine of very high quality. The Cabernet Sauvignon shines through, showing enormous black currant flavor, and then there are the wonderfully ripe, smooth tannins that make the wine glide like velvet. It seems to be best now, but should hold for some years.",93,100.0,California,Stags Leap District,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chimney Rock
France,"Banana and ripe red-berry notes create the attractive open of this bright wine. It comes with a raw edge, but if slightly chilled it would make for a fine apéritif.",87,10.0,Beaujolais,Beaujolais-Villages,Gamay,Henry Fessy
Italy,There's a smoky or almost burnt element to the nose here that takes away from the overall purity of the fruit. The wine is piquant and a bit sharp and those toasted notes sit heavy on the finish.,84,39.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,Chardonnay,Volpe Pasini
US,"This crisp white is inviting and dry, with aromas of citrus, fig and fennel. Reminiscent of a fine Sancerre, it's finely structured, steely and still lushly textured and full enough in the mouth to enjoy with seafood, a creamy goat cheese salad or entirely on its own.",92,18.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Sauvignon Blanc,Easton
Italy,"Five Roses was one of Italy's first quality rosé wines. The blend is 90% Negroamaro and 10% Malvasia Nera; its bouquet is redolent of ripe blueberry, raspberry and white almond. The fresh fruit component is pure and clean.",87,17.0,Southern Italy,Salento,Rosé,Leone de Castris

Argentina,"Aromas of violets, blackberry and black currant jam are solid, while the palate shows sharper acidity than most Bonardas, and thus a juicy sensation along with flavors of snappy black cherry and boysenberry. Fresh and forward, with a lot of fruit and potency.",87,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Bonarda,Cruz Alta
US,"This meaty, substantial wine was barrel fermented in neutral oak and hints at oxidation, particularly in terms of its dusty, tawny color. Clocking in at 14.9% alcohol, it definitely shows some heat on the finish. But it's a full-bodied style with immediate appeal, lush with candied fruit flavors, streaks of butter and toasted nuts. Its weight and mouthfeel are very much like a ripe Chardonnay, but with added perfume and precision.",88,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier,Gamache
Italy,"Dolcetto Vigna Costa Fiore opens with a dense, modern appearance and big aromas of ripe fruit and mature blackberry. There's also a touch of Band Aid or wet animal at the back that is barely perceptible now, but that may worsen with time. The wine is chewy and bright on the close.",86,26.0,Piedmont,Dolcetto di Diano d'Alba,Dolcetto,Cascina Adelaide

France,"While maturing well, this wine still promises a considerable future. It is sweet and rich, honeyed almost while allowing room for a touch of dry spice and pepper. It's a ripe wine with depth of flavor and density. Drink from 2016.",93,24.0,Alsace,Alsace,Pinot Gris,Henri Ehrhart
US,"Imagine a Sauvignon Blanc with the weight of Chardonnay, and that's what you get with this single-vineyard wine. It's amazing, because the wine never saw oak. Still, it has a vanilla richness on top of pineapple, peach, anise and honeysuckle flavors. Maybe the correct comparison is of a white Cabernet Sauvignon, with the complexity that implies. What a great value.",93,17.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Dutton Estate

US,"Palette is a sensational value from one of Walla Walla's still-unrecognized superstar vineyards, Spofford Station. This Cab/Merlot blend is saturated with fruit and beautifully crafted. In a difficult year (2004 froze out most Walla Walla vineyards) it is a rare jewel.

Spain,"Spice, herbs, smoked meat and a dark core work in harmony on the bouquet. The palate on this well-made Reserva packs black cherry, cassis and plum, and that's followed by a stylish, smooth finish that comes on buttery at first and then settles in. Doesn't overwhelm but complements food nicely. Tasted twice.",90,40.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo,Conde de la Salceda

Italy,"This 50-50 Merlot-Cab Franc blend is priced irresistibly low. Aromas include red cherry fruit, chocolate and spice that give it a modern edge. It has plenty of dimension and some oak nuances in the mouth.",87,10.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Red Blend,Villa Pillo
Australia,"Light in body for a Shiraz, with savory elements of meat and pepper complemented by touches of plum and berry fruit. Drink up.",83,8.0,South Australia,South Australia,Shiraz,Cockatoo Ridge
US,"Argyle's reserve shows more barrel flavor than the regular Willamette Valley bottling, highlighting an interesting mix of Asian spice and coffee. But the tannins are oddly absent; there seems to be a bit of a hole in the back of the wine. It opens beautifully, then hits a dead spot. A good wine, but missing something.",87,37.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Argyle
France,"This is a rugged, firmly tannic rendering of Châteauneuf-du-Pape that requires time in the cellar to reach its full potential. That said, it may also pose a risk, because there are hints of Band-Aid on the nose and a slightly metallic edge to the finish that may worsen over time. The other flavors are potent and concentrated: plum, chocolate and licorice all leave lasting impressions on the palate. Try after 2016.",92,77.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,Rhône-style Red Blend,Tardieu-Laurent
France,"Attractive and enticing, with aromas of dried red fruit and raspberry dust spiced up with notes of pepper, cocoa and toffee.

US,"100% Merlot from Klipsun and Ciel. Opens tart and hard, than strolls into somewhat grassy, slightly herbaceous territory. Tart acids and green tea tannins keep your lips at attention; it shows good concentration and will taste best with rich foods.",88,32.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Merlot,JM Cellars
US,"If you like a little sugary sweetness in your white wines, this is a good one. It's crisp in acidity and very clean, with pie-filling flavors of pineapples, apricots, green apples, vanilla and honeysuckles.",85,14.0,California,High Valley,Pinot Grigio,Brassfield
US,"This offers reserved notes of cherry and raspberry compote, cranberry, earth and assorted dried herbs. With the oak pleasantly dialed back, the focus remains on the fruit. The palate displays exquisite purity, elegance and detail, with a light grip of tannins pulling it all together. It's drinking beautifully now, but you could open it up in 2025 or 2030 and it wouldn't bat an eye.",93,32.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Gramercy
US,"This is certainly a better Chard than the winery's '04. It's richer and more succulent, overall more rewarding in varietal fruit, including peaches and cream, pineapples, guavas and papayas, with a cinnamon spice finish. The wine also is characterized by crisp, crunchy acidity that makes it racy.",90,18.0,California,Carneros,Chardonnay,Sequoia Grove
France,"Very much on the ripe, tropical side of Sauvignon Blanc, this is rich and concentrated. There are citrus and toast along with the spice and pineapple. Textured, it is still young and will age.",89,19.0,Bordeaux,Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,Sauvignon Blanc,Château Haut Bertinerie

US,"Another polished, succulent release from a vineyard that's not supposed to be warm enough to ripen Cabernet. Of course, the vintage was very good, and this effort shows upfront blackcurrant and leather flavors, with a long, fruity finish. It's generously oaked, and really excellent.",90,42.0,California,Russian River Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Longboard

US,"This is harder than the 2008, which was released at the same time, but it shows real Napa elegance. The tannic toughness tells you to decant it for a few hours, which makes the blackberry and cassis flavors become more expressive.",88,29.0,California,Napa Valley,Red Blend,Worthy
US,"Firm, chewy, young, tight and yet quite supple and fulfilling, this stunning Cabernet is packed with a rainbow of fruit flavors—blueberry, black currant and black cherry—that open into a seamless, beautifully proportioned wine. The scents and flavors run the gamut from citrus peel to clove to oy to chocolate, espresso and beyond.",95,45.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Betz Family
France,"Along with the natural power of Corton-Charlemagne, this wine shows fragrant yellow-fruit and pineapple flavors, rich texture and a steely edge. The taut character and the orange zest and wood-derived flavors lend this selection crispness and aging potential. Keep it for at least seven years.",93,24.0,Burgundy,Corton-Charlemagne,Chardonnay,Domaine Champy
France,"This ratchets up the intensity from Voge's other Saint-Pérays, bringing waves of toasty, mealy and citrusy aromas and flavors. It seems almost floral on the nose, yet is authoritatively weighty on the palate. It's powerful, yet crisp, with a long, velvety-textured finish. Delicious now, but should hold well.",93,52.0,Rhône Valley,Saint-Péray,Marsanne,Alain Voge

US,"Sourced from estate vines planted in 1972, this is historic, yet not quite as rich in the details that some newer Pinot clones might provide. Cranberry and raspberry fruit hit the palate in a tangy twirl, with a kiss of oak from 25% new French barrels. It's well-balanced and fresh, with a chance to improve considerably with a few more years of bottle age; try after 2017.",90,125.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Pinot Noir,Adelsheim
US,"This 52% Syrah-48% Grenache blend from Amador has a lot of barnyard on the nose, the muted herb and spice that's in there having to fight for attention. The wine struggles to find its balance over time (it was tasted twice over the course of one day), the aromas and flavors falling off into dusty tannins and not enough fruit.",83,19.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Syrah-Grenache,Amador Foothill Winery

US,"Chateau Ste. Michelle makes more Riesling than any winery in the country, and this bottling, at 553,500 cases, may qualify as the largest single Riesling production in the world. It's a great bottle of wine, priced for everyday consumption, yet loaded with fresh fruit flavors of peach, pear and melon. Washington state built its white wine reputation on Riesling, and Riesling is more popular than ever before (statewide it is the third most planted grape, and production is up 23 percent in the past two years). This version is off-dry, lightly spiced and perfectly framed by vibrant acids.",89,8.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"A new entry in the Dusted Valley lineup, this offering is co-fermented with Viognier and includes a small amount of Petite Sirah as well.

A delicious underpinning of mineral and graphite anchor the lengthy finish.",93,53.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah,Dusted Valley

US,"This is flat-out classy, polished and elegant Merlot, made with fruit from a premier vineyard on Red Mountain. There's a lush mix of cherries, plums and berries to start, a nice toasty, cocoa frame, fine balance and a firm, confident finish. Despite its youth it's focused and appealing, but a little time will really open it up. Cellar Selection.",92,40.0,Washington,Washington,Merlot,Andrew Will
US,"This is tart and shows mixed flavors of red berries, cranberry and hints of black cherry. The acids are upfront and forceful, and the usual herbal components seem muted. Perhaps the wine is in a bit of a dumb phase, but it is not showing the texture and length of previous Red Willow Cabs.",86,27.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Columbia Winery
Italy,"Inspired by the Italian word for pearl, La Perlara is a delicious dessert wine that boasts a luminous golden color and intense aromas of honey, almond, apricot and sweet yellow rose.

Drink after 2015.",93,24.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Nebbiolo,Gaja
Argentina,"This is always one of Mendoza's classiest blends. There's big fruit, dry wood, bacon and balsamic notes on the alluring bouquet.

Italy,"Santadi's Terre Brune is a wine that sets the bar for the region it represents: in this case, the island of Sardinia. The hot 2003 vintage delivers loads of red fruit and cherry that borders on cherry comfiture.

US,"Opening with competing scents of menthol and fruit preserves, this hits the palate with peppery spice, ample minerality and nicely restrained jamminess.

Spain,"A bit transparent in color, but only by Priorat standards. The nose, however, offers all the crusty, earthy red fruit you'd expect; it leads nicely into a palate of sweet cherry, plum and vanilla. Big enough on the finish, with mouthfeel galore.

US,"This unusual project, a single Bordeaux blend from a mix of vintages, has put out its second wine. It is, as you would expect, rounder and more advanced than the usual new releases, with melded flavors and softened tannins.

Argentina,"There's no other way to put it: Perdriel from Norton is one of Argentina's best high-end blends. It's rich and extracted, but still carries that just-right mix of preserving acidity, structured tannins and dynamite fruit.

Italy,"This wine is held back for eight years by the winery before it is released for sale.

A good wine that should not offend anyone.",87,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Trivento

Italy,"Easy in approach and execution, this is a traditional Rosso di Montalcino characterized by immediate blueberry and wild strawberry aromas that you will want to drink with roasted pork or wild mushroom risotto.

US,"Just under five years in age, this wine's Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant profile shows through its full-bodied mouthfeel, dense tannins and cassis flavor. It's a big, new-oaky wine that's forward with concentrated fruit through the finish.

Drink now for freshness.",92,30.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel,Dogwood

US,"Roessler produces lots of single-vineyard wines, but this has not been one of their best ones. It's a good wine, not without interest, with plenty of compact cherry, raspberry and sandalwood flavors. But it's very acidic. Decant it for hours.",88,46.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir,Roessler

Italy,"Dark ruby with a burgundy-brown hue to its color, this wine seems older than it is and should be consumed within the next two years.

US,"Softly tannic and creamy, and bone dry, with black and red cherry, red currant, cinnamon, cocoa, bacon, black pepper and violet notes that have a pleasantly bitter bite on the finish.

A velvety texture is complemented by a bite of oak and tannin that flirts with grip.",92,75.0,California,Sonoma County,Pinot Noir,Benovia
France,"Very fresh, vivid red berry fruits are the hallmark of this attractive wine. The acidity is prominent, a slash of crispness through the sweeter jelly fruits.

US,"A lovely Cabernet Sauvignon that shows its fine mountain pedigree. Accessible now, with decanting, for the upfront blackberry, black currant, plum, sweet cedar and mineral flavors that feel so rich and balanced and drily tannic. Should develop well over the next 6-8 years.",93,75.0,California,Napa,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vineyard 7&8
Spain,"Aromas of mineral and jammy raspberry are attractive, yet the palate seems a bit metallic and clicky, with hard to penetrate flavors of rooty fruits, vanilla, coconut and cola.

Italy,"A very characteristic wine of southern Italy, the nose delivers cherry, berry, tobacco, root beer, balsamic, red earth and linseed oil aromas.

The wine is elegant in the mouth with crisp acidity and a long finish.",88,16.0,Southern Italy,Aglianico del Vulture,Aglianico,Vigne di Mezzo
Argentina,"An oaky, complex wine based on Malbec, Cabernet and Merlot, The Blend shows floral notes unmatched by almost all other Mendoza/Tupungato wines. Violets and rose petals interact with earthy fruit on both the nose and palate. And unlike the masses, this wine doesn't make its point by pounding away with overextracted fruit. A different breed but well worth it. Only 40 cases made.",90,49.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Finca Sophenia

US,"Jacaman's been doing a good job with their Russian River Pinot. This one's a bit off the pace of the '03, due to the hotter vintage that makes the wine riper and simpler. But it's still a flavorful, dry, silky wine, with a fair degree of complexity. Drink now.",87,40.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,J. Jacaman
Spain,"Take the bubbles out of Cava and this is pretty much what's left. The nose is light, with peach and banana aromas.

For flush flavors and just enough zap, this is good.",84,13.0,Catalonia,Penedès,White Blend,Huguet de Can Feixes
Australia,"Blackberry and vanilla flavors take on a maple character with air, but on the palate, it's all bouncy fruit, all the time. Finishes with sweet vanilla notes.

US,"This is a young wine that needs cellaring to come around. Right now, it's tough in tannins, and the fruit is direct and primary. It really needs the alchemy of time for the wood, acids, tannins and flavors to come around.

US,"This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from an all-star collection of Walla Walla vineyards. It shows excellent structure and depth, with plenty of herbal character. The black fruits are abundant, spicy and sharp; this is a young wine from a great vintage than needs more bottle age. The layering, though still tight and compact, suggests that with cellaring this will evolve into Bordeaux-like complexity, with a mix of herb, mineral, leaf and berry flavors. The barrel flavors (40% new) are subtle and elegant.",93,40.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,L'Ecole No. 41

US,"Brandborg really knocks it out of the park with this Gewürztraminer, the strongest in a very solid lineup of white wines.

Offers wave after wave of cherries, pomegranates, rhubarb pie, roasted coconut, red licorice, tangerine zest, sweet vanilla oak and Asian spices through a long finish.",95,52.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
Italy,"This Roero benefits from an added layer of spice, clove and cinnamon that sits tight over floral notes and wild berries (a tiny percent of Barbera is added to the blend). There's a charred, smoky tone in the mouth and the finish is tight but firm.",87,24.0,Piedmont,Roero,Nebbiolo,Marsaglia

US,"The grapes were farmed biodynamically, fermented with wild yeasts, and just two barrels were aged in new oak. The stiff berry fruit is cloaked in details of stem and earth, tart acids and a whiff of compost.",87,35.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Day
Spain,"Raisin and brick dust aromas get this mature wine going. The palate feels blocky and closed, with firm tannins and strong acidity. Flavors of earthy plum and raisin are echoed by vanilla and spare oak on the finish.",84,24.0,Central Spain,Finca Élez,Red Blend,Manuel Manzaneque
US,"This Pinot is pure California in its ripe fruitiness. It's explosive in cherry and raspberry jam flavors, with sandalwood and dusty spice notes, and also displays crisp, cool-climate acidity. A delicious wine to drink now.",90,38.0,California,Monterey,Pinot Noir,Wrath

US,"Made in a dry, acidic style, this Viognier steers clear of the variety's flamboyant personality, offering controlled citrus, mineral, apricot and spice flavors. It's clean and vibrant. Try as an interesting alternative to Sauvignon Blanc.",87,24.0,California,Paso Robles,Viognier,Oso Libre
France,"Toasty and rich-smelling, like brioche, but it isn't one-dimensional, as it picks up fruitier notes of apple and citrus. Ends on a chalky note. Imported by Vranken America.",91,120.0,Champagne,Champagne,Champagne Blend,Heidsieck & Co Monopole

Canada,"An unusual Merlot icewine, this is clear and quite lovely in the glass, with shades of sunset orange and mahogany, like burnished wood. It's unctuous and sugary in the mouth, with grainy flavors of sugarcane, strawberry jam and sweet cherry liqueur. Quite thick for an icewine, with a cloying finish.",88,145.0,British Columbia,Okanagan Valley,Merlot,Ex Nihilo
US,"A lightly tawny straw color, this is scented with grass and hay and smoked meat—unusual for a Chardonnay. Light apple-flavored fruit carries that same, strong smoked meat (and slightly plastic) streak of flavor—unmissable and quite persistent.",85,19.0,Oregon,Oregon,Chardonnay,Oak Knoll
Italy,"Pian Cavallo is a unique and distinct wine that will appeal to those who appreciate a bigger, more robust style of Barbaresco.

Spain,"A high level of purity from the start. The bouquet attracts with strong scents of mineral, flowers, wild herbs, berry fruit and toast. There's no shortage of bracing acidity, so the body weight and balance are just right. One of Spain's most food-friendly, elegant wines, and not run of the mill. The best expression of Mencia on the market today.",92,45.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,Mencía,Descendientes de J. Palacios
US,"For the last several years Surh Luchtel has been tinkering to get this wine right. The '05 is their best yet, a dry, silky, light-bodied wine, with complex layers of cherry skin, rhubarb pie, root beer, rose petal and red licorice flavors, enhanced with toasted new oak. The winemaker seems to be striving to tame the aggressive character this vineyard can bring to Pinot, in favor of delicacy and elegance. He has largely succeeded. A wine to watch.",92,50.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir,Surh Luchtel
Argentina,"Deep, dark and charred on the nose, this features campfire and black cherry aromas. It feels fresh, alert and snappy for being so dark and ripe, with blackberry and padded oak flavors. It's layered and a touch creamy on the finish. A modern, powerful Malbec to drink now–2016.",91,40.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Melipal
France,"This rosé needs to age. It has a zesty, crisp and mineral texture that is tight and nervy.

US,"Whole berry fermentation and aging in neutral oak yield an aromatic, high-toned, fruity wine with a woody character—not new oak, but rather the flavor of neutral wood and gentle oxidation.

Italy,"Here's a special sparkling wine from Villa Sandi with intense notes of peachy fruit, sweet apple and pear.

Italy,"Sparkling wines like this “Dosaggio Zero” (made from 50-50 Chardonnay and Pinot Nero) show the best of the territory they come from and promise to pair with a long list of foods. This example offers tones of citrus, stone fruit and almond. The wine is never heavy or too dense.",91,39.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,Sparkling Blend,Contadi Castaldi
Italy,"Chardonnay (75%) and Grillo are blended to produce an intense wine with pungent notes of ripe fruit, pineapple, candied lemon and yellow rose.

Spain,"Different from the crowd. The nose concedes light raspberry and cranberry aromas, while the palate is a pink passion play that's not that easy to figure out. It's tangy, with citrus and berry mixing in an unconventional manner. Interesting in the mouth; a quality wine. Not run of the mill. Imported by De Maison Selections, Inc.",87,20.0,Catalonia,Cava,Sparkling Blend,Avinyó
US,"A bit heavy in body, and very extracted, this single-vineyard Pinot from Boonville has jammy flavors of cherries, raspberries and currants. Extensive new oak adds layers of caramelized meringue. Tasty, although a bit obvious, the wine should hold its own for 5 years.",89,55.0,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Noir,MacPhail
US,"A wonderful red wine, full-bodied, dry and elegant. It shows Cabernet character in the blackberries, cherries and black currants, but that's balanced with an earthiness and minerality and even some smoked meat notes that must come from a percentage of Syrah and Petite Sirah. Tasted in a flight of much more expensive Cabs, this one easily stood out. Drink now–2011.",92,16.0,California,Mendocino-Lake,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bonterra

The mouthfeel is intense and generous and this wine boasts a particularly creamy, full and satisfying mouthfeel.",90,30.0,Northeastern Italy,Trento,Sparkling Blend,Ferrari
US,"Feels heavy and ponderous now, almost like a common Grenache, and might age, but it's a gamble. Made in a particular style of extreme ripeness, the wine features blackberries, currants, red licorice and spices, and is fully dry.",85,48.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir,A.P. Vin
Italy,"This is a fully unique expression of Nebbiolo with distinct aromas of bacon fat, dried salami, bresaola and playful accents of black fruit and exotic spice. The intensity and power are terrific and the wine is tart, chewy and bright on the close. That inherent freshness makes a nice contrast to those heavier meaty aromas.",91,24.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Nebbiolo,Adriano Marco & Vittorio
US,"Tight when first opened, with polished fruit flavors of blackberry and cassis, mingling with barrel accents of anise and clove. The alcohol, listed at 13.5%, does not indicate the weight and power of the wine. One caveat—there is a chalky aftertaste from the combination of very dry tannins and citrusy acids.",90,100.0,Washington,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,Boudreaux Cellars
US,"Quite a bit of Tempranillo is being planted in southern Oregon, and it shows considerable promise. The flavors here suggest cherry cobbler, with ripe fruit at the center. There are streaks of citrus and a touch of toast in the mix, with drying tannins.",87,26.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Tempranillo,Melrose
US,"Lots of people will like this wine, but it is a little hot in high alcohol and excessively soft. The jammy blackberry and cherry have a baked, raisiny edge. Definitely made in a warm, ripe California style. Drink now.",87,48.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Syrah,Stolpman
Italy,"The nose of this Sangiovese-Merlot is muscular and broad, with a hint of earth and mushroom sneaking in between the folds of deep red fruit. More robust fruit fills out the palate, while it finishes long and chocolaty, with notes of coffee. Quite sturdy and eminently satisfying.",91,28.0,Tuscany,Chianti,Sangiovese,Borgo Salcetino

US,"Voluptuous in the mouth, with a velvety, chocolate-layer-cake richness. It has flavors of cassis liqueur and blackberries in every form—from freshly picked to dried. It's a delicious wine for drinking now and over the next few years.",90,30.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Estate 1856
US,"Feels like a crisp, silky Sauvignon Blanc, with citrus, lemongrass and mineral flavors and brisk acidity, but much richer due to the addition of tangerines and butter-creamy peaches. A nice appetizer wine for things like mushroom-filled pastries, goat cheese and salumi plates.",87,18.0,California,Central Coast,Pinot Gris,Claiborne & Churchill

The intensity and persistency are impressive and the wine is also cooling and pleasantly refreshing.",89,33.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,Chardonnay,Maurigi
France,"Described as doux (sweet), this is a wine from superripe, rather than botrytis, fruit. The flavors are of black currant jelly, spiced with cranberry and acidity. It is really an apéritif wine, its fresh character just as important as its sweetness.",89,24.0,Loire Valley,Savennières-Roche-Aux-Moines,Chenin Blanc,Domaine aux Moines
US,"Very light pink, this rosé offers extremely pleasant and approachable aromas of nectarine, pluot, plum, lime and a dusting of vanilla.

US,"This tight, chewy, spicy Syrah fills out as it breathes. Though not as big and ripe as the other Tulpen reds, this brings in subtle nuances of herb, spice, mint and white pepper. Bottom line: more structure, but less hedonistic fruit.",89,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah,Tulpen

France,"This is a wonderful wine, which comes from the vineyard in the south of Alsace that the Humbrechts brought back from obscurity. It has both intensity and also great elegance. It has flavors of currants, layers of orange zest and some fresh acidity. But it also has spice which lies gently with the fruit flavors. The taste just goes on forever.",96,102.0,Alsace,Alsace,Pinot Gris,Domaine Zind-Humbrecht

US,"This Napa-side-of-Carneros Chardonnay is resplendent in crisp yet hearty aromas of apple, pear and flowery jasmine.

US,"The 2004 vintage was a rough ride in Washington, and Ste. Michelle generously shared a lot of fruit from their vineyards that escaped the freeze. One senses that Snoqualmie drew the short straw, as these 2004 reserve wines are well below the quality that this outstanding value producer has shown in the past. This is not reserve quality by any stretch of the imagination; it's light, watery and vegetal.",83,23.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah,Snoqualmie

US,"This is a very fine, distinctive Chardonnay that's tight and streamlined. It's tangy with lemony acidity and a brisk minerality, but there's also plenty of tropical fruit, apricot and honey flavors as well. Creamy notes of buttered toast and lees add richness to the palate.",92,40.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay,Bernardus
US,"Vintage seems to have made all the difference in this 100% Cabernet. The 2005 was rich and fat, the 2006 less so. You'll find plenty of acidity framing the juicy blackberry and black currant flavors. It seems to be very finely layered, so your best bet is to cellar it for 6–8 years and see what happens.",89,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,The Grade
Italy,"Capanna's offering in 2007 is extremely bold, dark and opulent. Loads of aromatic momentum in the form of blackberry, cherry liqueur, spice, leather, tobacco, rum cake, cinnamon, vanilla bean and bitter chocolate characterize the bouquet.

Australia,"This wine is a bit hard and ungenerous but certainly not lacking in concentration or intensity. Cassis and cedar scents give way to dark, chocolaty flavors.

Spain,"A touch horsey at first, but with time it settles on saddle leather and earthy fruit. The palate is chunky and beefy, with some funk, chocolate and herbal black fruit.

Spain,"A touch of vinegar and volatility sits atop the nose, but there's fruit and weight under the surface. It feels tannic and slightly sour, with sharp acidity pushing zesty flavors of tomato, red cherry, red plum and herbs. Tasted twice with inconsistent results; this note reflects both wines that were tried.",82,12.0,Northern Spain,Bierzo,Mencía,Castillo Colina
US,"A very fine Cabernet, blended with some Petit Verdot which seems to add body and perfume, but it's quite young, and needs some time to resolve its issues.

Should develop healthily for 6–8 years.",89,50.0,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon,Riboli

Argentina,"A tough sell at this price. The nose is minty, green and smells of tobacco, spice and fern fronds, while the palate is tangy, clangy in feel and dry.

US,"A power-packed heavyweight from Sonoma, this delivers a piercing black-fruit aroma and flavor profile.

US,"So savory and easy to like, you might miss the complexity, but it's there.

Hold until 2008, if possible.",91,35.0,Catalonia,Priorat,Red Blend,Joan Simó
US,"This vineyard bottling is very vintage driven. The cool 2009 harvest has made it ripe and tart in cherry pie flavors, but also rather tannic.

Spain,"A nutty and acidic wine, with aromas of pressed walnuts and toffee. Feels tight, sharp and narrow on the tongue, with blazing acidity and dry, limited, salty flavors that fold in toffee and sour fruit notes. Exceedingly salty on the finish; smells great but feels and tastes astringent for such an expensive bottling.",87,100.0,Andalucia,Jerez,Sherry,Pedro Romero
France,"A highly perfumed wine boasting some firm tannins and a core of dryness.

Australia,"Pie cherry and rhubarb notes make a bright impression on the nose, followed by tart flavors bundled in a mocha-tinged wrapper. The texture is almost syrupy on the midpalate, but turns dry and dusty on the finish. This is a bit disjointed at this stage, so perhaps it will improve with cellaring.

US,"This particular cuvée is fermented in a large acacia barrel which helps to round out the fruity flavors without sacrificing focus or precision.

US,"Tasted alongside the winery's DCV3 bottling, this one's considerably more focused in fruit, altogether a more interesting wine. It's also much higher in alcohol.

US,"Winemaker Trey Busch gets more confident and assured with each new vintage, and this is his best cab yet. It's 100% cabernet sauvignon, from the Lewis, Seven Hills and Spoffard Station vineyards. Light scents suggest cherry tobacco, and cherries are the main theme here, ripened to 14.7% alcohol, but balanced, firm and packed with fruit. The blend was done right after fermentation, which gives it a head start at this young age, and the tannins and oak are beautifully managed.",90,32.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Basel Cellars

US,"A beautiful, elegant and dramatic blend for drinking now and over the next 6–10 years. Based on Cabernet, and sourced from vineyards including Beckstoffer ToKalon and Showket, it's flashy in blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors, with gorgeous, refined tannins. It's throwing some tannins, so you might want to give it a proper decant.",93,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Merryvale
France,"In Champagne-speak, Extra Dry means sweeter than Brut, so this is a soft wine, fruity rather than mineral. Pear and fresh green plum flavors are balanced by orange zest and final acidity.

Drink this from early 2016.",88,24.0,Champagne,Champagne,Champagne Blend,Louis de Sacy
US,"This Zin tastes overtly sweet. It may be because there's residual sugar, or because the alcohol is 15.9%, or a combination of both. At any rate, it's unbalanced, Porty and hot, despite some savory cherry-berry jam flavors.",82,35.0,California,Mount Veeder,Zinfandel,Peter Franus

Spain,"What makes this varietal Syrah score high is not that it's over the top, superlush or heavily oaked, but that it's balanced to a tee. Black cherry, blackberry and spice aromas are more solid than they are special, while the palate folds together flavors of baked fruit, berry, mocha and tobacco. It doesn't expand much on the finish, but by then the story has been told.",90,25.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,Syrah,Marqués de la Concordia

US,"The vintage brut is the same blend and receives the same treatment as the NV, but the best barrels are chosen and it gets an extra three years en tirage. Just 300 cases were made of the '98.

Italy,"There's no other wine like this in the world, and it won't appeal to everyone. Anfora is matured in ceramic amphorae for seven months in a throwback to ancient winemaking techniques to achieve a deep golden color and penetrating aromas of resin, caramel, chestnut honey and cola.

US,"This is a very rich Chardonnay marked by creamy, leesy, butter and oak notes that give it an exotic sweetness.

It's a dark, extracted wine, filled with wild cherry, raspberry, currant and sandalwood flavors, as well as exotic notes of forest balsam, grilled mushrooms, tamari and dusty Indian spices.

US,"The amount of alcohol in this Syrah has increased in 2010, which will appeal to some palates. The downside is the loss of texture and subtlety.

Spain,"Plant-by-plant fruit selection leads to intensity, concentration and structure. Aro shows gripping tannins and juicy acidity, and overall it reeks of power and precision.

Beyond the mouthfeel are flavors so complex, they're hard to describe. The blend consists of Cabernet Sauvignon, with contributions from Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, and each grape brings its own distinction, as does 100% new oak. It's approachable now for the softness, and should glide through the next 6–8 years with ease.

US,"From a warm vintage, this aromatic offering has notes of candy corn, corn silk, pear and tropical fruit. It's full bodied with sweet fruit flavors that have a creamy feel and lead to a lingering finish.",90,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay,Ryan Patrick
US,"Vegetal, with an asparagus edge to the citrus fruit flavors. That mars this otherwise clean, dry and zesty Chardonnay.",82,10.0,California,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Concannon
US,"This is a gem—40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot and 30% Cab Franc. Dense, fruity and salty, it also carries concentrated chocolate and coffee flavors, surrounding very rich cassis and black cherry fruits. A superb value.",90,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,OS Winery
US,"Tart but full cranberry aromas meld with sagebrush and cardamom on the nose of this bottling from an increasingly popular vineyard in this appellation. Baking spice and dried ginger mark the palate, which is acid-driven and lively, accenting its core of raspberry and pencil lead flavors.",91,44.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir,Silver Mountain
France,"The top cuvée from Sainte Roseline, this is a wood-aged wine. That gives a strongly spicy character on top of the sophisticated fruit. The wine is smooth and complex, with red plums and fragrant acidity going well with the elegant aftertaste.",92,24.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,Rosé,Château Sainte Roseline
Italy,"Il Tesoro is a pure expression of Merlot. The wine will immediately grab your attention thanks to generous and refined notes of sweet cherry, blueberry, vanilla bean, licorice, Indian spice and chocolate fudge. It imparts deliciously soft, velvety tannins in the mouth.",91,43.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Merlot,Terrabianca
Italy,"Closed now, but the impressive depth and richness of fruit and texture are still evident. Opens with aromas of black and blueberries, touches of carob and cinnamon. Chewy, yet smooth and polished, cocoa and espresso accent the subdued very dark cherry fruit. Shows dusty tannins and a leathery note on the long finish. Cellar til 2005.",90,25.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,Sangiovese,Viticcio
US,"With the creamy, yeasty notes of lees stirring and fine, smoky oak nuances, this soft, buttery Chardonnay is rich in lemon, lime and white peach flavors. It's an upscale sipper that will develop bottle nuances over the next six years.",90,55.0,California,Alexander Valley,Chardonnay,Stonestreet
US,"Lovely aromatics mix floral, fruit and barrel components in equal proportion. The wine has some solid tannins, and sits in the mouth with a bit of gravitas. Wild cherry, raspberry, fresh herb, and a little stiffness to the finish. Definitely a wine to age a few more years.",89,24.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Pinot Noir,Bethel Heights
Spain,"A holdover from 1999, this varietal single-vineyard Cabernet offers tree bark, molasses and prune on the nose, while the palate has raspberry flavors sitting front and center, with drying tannins in support. It's a woody and grabby wine, with vanilla notes toward the end. And at eight years old, it doesn't appear as though it will improve beyond where it's at now. So drink soon.",86,55.0,Catalonia,Penedès,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pago Jean Leon
US,"Great price for a wine of this complexity and satisfaction. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with a wealth of lemon, lime and grapefruit citrus flavors and richer notes of peach pie and yellow apricot purée. Almost seems underpriced for what you get.",88,20.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Mosaic
Spain,"Bee's wax, roast squash and vanilla are the dominant aromas, and all indicate a fading wine that was borderline overripe to begin with. The flavors are of apple and melon, and the finish is pithy and turns bitter toward the final stages. Not really what we're looking for from Rías Baixas.",82,24.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,Albariño,Adegas Gran Vinum
France,"A warm, ripe, apricot-flavored wine, this has a smooth feel, with notes of pear and anise. The acidity adds to the minerality and texture. For drinking now.",90,25.0,Southwest France,Jurançon Sec,Gros Manseng,Domaine Bru-Baché
US,"This is Stephen Ross's best Bien Nacido Pinot in recent years, showing a great marriage of power and refinement. The wine shows primary fruit, dusty spices and acids. It's a little dry and angular, but will reward some cellaring. So complex, yet you can drink it now, but decant first.",93,35.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Noir,Stephen Ross
Spain,"For a few years running we've been singing the praises of Abadal, a label from Catalonia that has been producing hit upon hit. This blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah from the excellent 2001 vintage is in super form; the wine has a ripe, integrated nose of cocoa, dark fruit and chocolate, while the palate is bold and loaded with vivacious cherry and blackberry flavors. From front to center to back, this wine has it all going in the right direction. Good now through 2012.",92,23.0,Catalonia,Pla de Bages,Red Blend,Masies d'Avinyo

Italy,"Here's a beautifully chocolaty and rich blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with plush layers of sweet cherry, Indian spice, tobacco and espresso. The wine is amazingly rich and long lasting, with silky, supple tannins at the very end. Keep it in your cellar 10 years or more, or drink it now.",96,75.0,Tuscany,Bolgheri Superiore,Red Blend,Tenuta Argentiera
France,"This is a firm, chunky wine that shows ripe plum fruit and dark tannins. It has weight and richness that are balanced by the dense structure. It needs to age for at least four years.",90,20.0,Southwest France,Côtes de Bergerac,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Bélingard
US,"This vineyard has been source to Ottomino's best Zinfandels for years. The '08 is right up there, rich and sweet in briary berries, cola, mocha and pepper spice. The tannins are firm; the acidity is just right. A bit young and sweet in primary fruit, try aging it for a few years in the cellar.",91,38.0,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel,Ottimino Vineyards
US,"Spicy, ripe fruit, with an edge to it. Well-defined wine, which shows briar, toast, berry and coffee flavors sprinkled throughout. Well-built, sturdy, a little hot, but balanced and long.",88,14.0,California,Clear Lake,Zinfandel,Wildhurst
Canada,"This is a distinctive, well-made wine, with a strong streak of fennel running persistently through it. It's sharp, spicy and peppery, as you might expect from a low alcohol Chenin Blanc grown so far up north. By any standard it would be a fine seafood companion, crisp and clean.",87,15.0,British Columbia,Okanagan Valley,Chenin Blanc,Quails' Gate
Argentina,"This old-timer proves that Argentinean Malbec is not a great cellar dweller. This smells, tastes and feels much older than its eight years. It's full of tobacco, dried spices and a dominating leafiness. The blend is 70% Syrah and 30% Malbec.",82,24.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Red Blend,Finca La Anita
Spain,"A touch scratchy and rough on the nose, with pepper and leathery fruit aromas. The palate keeps that edge while offering peppery berry flavors and oak. More tannic and woody than one might hope for, with lactic notes on the finish. Shows flashes but comes up average. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.",85,24.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,Garnacha,Montgó
Argentina,"Tropical aromas are a tiny bit grassy and oily. In the mouth, this is acidic and tangy, while lime and green-herb flavors are snappy. Crisp citric acidity creates sizzle on a racy finish.",87,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Torrontés,Trivento
US,"There's an odd plastic note here. Firm and compact, with unyielding fruit; black cherry, leaf and black tea flavors dominate. This seems closed down even after being open for several hours.",91,50.0,Oregon,Yamhill-Carlton District,Pinot Noir,Soléna
Italy,"The complex aromas of rhubarb, coffee, black cherries, tar, anise, cedar and green tobacco evolve in the glass. Firm acids and tannins give this wine great structure; this should be a very long-lived Barbaresco despite its forward charms. From Ceretto. Cellar Selection.",91,111.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Nebbiolo,Ceretto
US,"The Jack is Saviah's everyday successful red blend, and accounts for half of the winery's 7,000 case production. This is sweet and bursting with ripe red fruit flavors of strawberry preserves, raspberries and peaches. It hits some hard tannins but the pretty fruit keeps on going.",87,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend,Saviah
US,"A Southern Rhône-style blend of Syrah, Grenache and Mourvèdre. Shows great flavors of berries, currants, cured meat, spices and sandalwood, and finishes dry and smooth. Could have a firmer structure, as it's a little soft and melted.",87,28.0,California,Santa Barbara County,G-S-M,Tercero
Italy,Astoria's Prosecco from the prestigious Cartizze vineyard delivers pristine notes of white mineral and stone fruit followed by a two-fold sensation of sweetness and crispness in the mouth.

US,"Once again, this bottling delivers a big, lush, complex and succulent young wine for Zin specialist Bella. Marked by extraordinary spices, the wine, with a little Petite Sirah, has powerful wild blackberry and raspberry, olive tapenade, cola and carob flavors that finish with a classic Zin briary, brambly character.",91,35.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel,Bella
US,"Off by a few beats from recent vintages, maybe because production was far higher, the '06 Westside is a good but ordinary Zinfandel. It's soft in acids and tannins, with jammy blackberry, raspberry, cherry and cola flavors that have a distinctly brambly edge.",85,19.0,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel,Peachy Canyon
US,"There's a harsh edge of acidic, green sharpness to this wine. It's bone dry, with very modest blackberry fruit.",82,11.0,California,California,Syrah,Robert Mondavi
US,"The vintage was a great one not only for J's dry table wines but for its sparklers. This brut, a classic Chardonnay and Pinot blend, with a drop of Pinot Meunier, is dry, with complex lemon, orange, yeast, vanilla, cream and toast flavors. The bubbles are ultra-fine, raising the appeal.",92,48.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sparkling Blend,J Vineyards & Winery
US,"Opens with the sort of sweet/tart impression that a German Kabinett might bring. The mouthfeel is quite light, but the flavors persist and include a pleasing mix of lemon, lime, grapefruit, apple and peach, with natural acids keeping it buoyant and lively.",88,15.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Riesling,Gilbert Cellars
US,"This wine has a flinty, minerally personality, with a full  overlay of toasty oak. Don't look for fat, blockbuster fruit here—the flavors tend toward lime and tangerine. The oak adds caramel, vanilla and smoky notes. It's supple in the mouth but closes strangely flat.",84,21.0,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay,Louis M. Martini
France,"Onion-skin color leads to a wine that is packed with deep fruit flavors. Considerably dry but a great food wine, with good acidity and ability to age well in bottle. The sample tasted was too young, and needed at least a year's aging. Imported by Domaine Select Wine Estates.",90,110.0,Champagne,Champagne,Champagne Blend,Alfred Gratien
US,"This Pinot's parts haven't found each other yet. There's big, ripe raspberry and cherry fruit, sweet, toasty oak, brisk acids and firm tannins, yet they form an unruly confederation. Stash this in the cellar until at least 2020.",89,65.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir,Bernardus
Australia,"The nose of this Bordeaux-like Cabernet displays strong herb and earth tones. Cassis, earth, dried herb and licorice flavors ride the even, medium-weight palate. The finish is dry, with tart berry and a slight citrus note.",86,13.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hope Estate
Italy,"This bright Dolcetto d'Alba offers fresh fruit and berry flavors on top of rich concentration and a plush, velvety feel. This is a very easy, uncomplicated wine that will pair with most home-cooked pasta dishes.",87,19.0,Piedmont,Dolcetto d'Alba,Dolcetto,E. Pira e Figli (Chiara Boschis)

Italy,"Subtle berry and wildflower aromas lead the nose of this bright, friendly red. The informal palate offers crushed wild cherry, raspberry and a hint of clove alongside soft, rather fleeting tannins.",86,14.0,Tuscany,Chianti,Red Blend,Fattoria Uccelliera
Italy,"This is a mostly Sangiovese-based wine that shows special territorial characteristics of Umbria in central Italy. The fruit is lively, bright and fresh tones of wild berries make this a versatile and food-friendly choice.",87,15.0,Central Italy,Torgiano,Red Blend,Lungarotti
US,"Cabernet Franc, used in Bordeaux blends and on its own in the Loire, is difficult to make into a complex wine in California. This bottling starts with aromas of black raspberry and spearmint, and drinks soft and fruity. It's a good wine, but on the simple side.",85,32.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Cabernet Franc,Clos La Chance
Argentina,"After a few years of stumbling around in Mendoza, this Concha y Toro project seems to have found its way. This wine, albeit oaky, is full of dark fruit, dill and toast aromas. The palate is balanced and tight, with firm tannins and plenty of black cherry, plum and coffee flavors. Toasty and lasting. Shows a lot of power and purity.",91,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Trivento
US,"From estate-grown fruit on the Oregon side of the Columbia Gorge AVA, this light and lemony wine seems to show some lees contact and just a hint of toasted cracker. It's simple and easy drinking, but lacks real depth.",85,18.0,Oregon,Columbia Gorge (OR),Pinot Gris,Wy'East Vineyards
Australia,"Although this is fortified, it's not overly so, with the finished alcohol level resting around 18%. The result is a decadently sweet mash-up of brandy-macerated raspberries that turn chocolaty on the finish. Although it lacks the complexity, tannic grip and minerality of the best true Ports, it's a tasty drop nonetheless. Drink now-2025.",90,40.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,Shiraz,D'Arenberg
France,"Deep yellow in color. This has a somewhat closed nose with hints of hay, yellow fruit and honey. The fairly low acidity magnifies the full body, round midpalate and creamy texture. A well-integrated note of buttered toast nods to the use of some new oak. This wine is for hearty poultry and polenta dishes.",87,24.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Limoux,Chardonnay,Domaine Begude
France,"This soft, warm rosé has plenty of Pinot Noir in the blend to give it weight. Raspberry and red plum notes accompany touches of tannin and minerality. The acidity is infectious, making this a great match for food.",90,54.0,Champagne,Champagne,Champagne Blend,Gaston Chiquet
Argentina,"Leather, dark fruit and citrus peel make for a good nose, while the palate is meaty and a bit heavy as it pours on those classic dark-fruit flavors that Malbec is known for. Best to get at this one now because neither the palate nor the finish shows much acidity. A touch hollow.",86,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Viña Amalia
US,"Made from a majority of Alexander Valley fruit, this is a smoky, chocolaty red wine, ripe in blackberry and an accent of clove. Rich, it remains fresh on the palate, with soft, supple tannins and an easygoing, lingering finish.",87,25.0,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Decoy
US,"Lots of inky, jammy aromas of black fruit set up the red-fruit palate that is covered with a blanket of powerful oak. Not a light-hearted cuvée; rather it's drying, concentrated and strong. With a few years of aging it could show additional subtleties.",90,75.0,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Livingston Moffett
US,"Marked by acidity and grapeskin bitterness, this is a Pinot Noir to stash in the cellar, in order to let everything resolve. It shows fresh, vibrant flavors of cherries, raspberries and red currants, and is very dry. Should hit its window of opportunity between 2010–2012.",88,49.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Noir,Armanino Family Cellars
France,"This wine is soft, creamy and light. Attractive acidity along with a fresh apple character gives a fresh aftertaste. Drink now.

Australia,"A satisfying steak house red, Oliverhill's 2008 Red Silk doesn't have the intensity or complexity of the Jimmy Section or Mount Benson Shirazes, but still offers plums and vanilla, plenty of weight and richness and a delicate dustiness on the finish. Drink now-2016.",89,37.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,Shiraz,Oliverhill
US,"Dry and tannic, with a hard mouthfeel and not enough richness to get past the goal line. Shows blackberry, black currant, herb and oak flavors, and a green herbaceousness suggesting dill and sage. Not an ager, so drink up.",86,30.0,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hans Fahden
France,"94–96 This is a beautiful Yquem, not huge or powerful, but with crispness, honey and freshness, very expressive of the year. The higher than usual proportion of Sauvignon in the blend gives it a real lift.",95,24.0,Bordeaux,Sauternes,Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc,Château d'Yquem
Australia,"This Cab seems narrow and kind of mainstream at first, but really blooms after a few minutes in the glass. Has menthol and carob accents on the nose, with a sweet-plum core of flavor. Blankets the tongue with textured tannins. Imported by Southern Starz, Inc.",90,17.0,New South Wales,Hunter Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Margan
US,"One of the region's top producers excels at exploring single-vineyard bottlings, and this is one of the best. A reductive nose of burnt rubber sinks into a fantastic menthol character, laid across plump black currants. The palate thrives on a minty blackberry element and complex black pepper and creosote flavors. A strong tannic structure ensures the best sipping 2018–2025.",92,52.0,California,Temecula Valley,Syrah,Leoness
France,"A touch of wet stone and wet earth accompanies the scent of ripe pear on the nose. The palate, therefore, surprises with luscious, off-dry peachiness and ample fruit: ripe pears and juicy peaches abound with expressive flavor. Their generosity is met with lemony freshness. This is utterly moreish and seductive with a lemony, just off-dry finish that makes you want to sip again.",91,32.0,Alsace,Alsace,Pinot Gris,Antoine Moltès & Fils
US,"The descriptor Deep Red perfectly captures the essence of this blend of Petite Sirah, Zinfandel, Syrah and Grenache. It's rich and full-bodied, with expressive, complex red wine flavors of red and black currants, spiced red plums, crushed pepper and hints of dark chocolate and anise. The tannic structure is wonderfully soft and intricate. Drink this beautiful wine now and for the next several years.",92,40.0,California,Mendocino,Red Blend,Paul Dolan
Italy,"From the Erice area of Sicily (in the southwest, near Trapani), Barone di Serramarrocco is made with Pignatello (also known by the name Perricone) and small percentages of other indigenous varieties. This oak-aged red shows dark concentration and toasted notes of almond and dried fruit.",87,24.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,Perricone,Tenuta di Serramarrocco
US,"Shows an herbaceous, earthy element that dilutes the fruity flavors, and this is compounded by tough tannins that lock in on the finish. Beef, lamb or similar fare will coax out the underlying sweetness.",85,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Waterstone
US,"Not as forward and lush as the appealing 2005, this all-purpose red, tasted a few months prior to its official release, is still knitting the components together. What is in place is plenty of tart, ripe raspberry fruit, precise and clean, and a soft backdrop of lightly chocolaty tannins.",87,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend,Waterbrook
US,"A fine wine to drink now, this has the dryness that suggests pairing it with goat cheese. It has rich flavors of gooseberries, limes and vanilla, with a little smokiness from the oak.",88,39.0,California,Rutherford,Sauvignon Blanc,Del Dotto
France,"Rounder and fuller than in previous years. The color is a bit gold and the nose offers aromas of lemon and peach touched up by some toast.

Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",86,23.0,Loire Valley,Menetou-Salon,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Henry Pellé
Australia,"Effectively the third-tier effort from this producer (there's a regular bottling and a reserve in vintages that warrant them), the 2008 Little Yering is nonetheless a respectable Pinot Noir. It's undeniably herbal in tone, but matches those elements with modest cherry fruit, a slightly chunky texture and a tangy finish. Drink now.",84,13.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,Pinot Noir,Yering Station
US,"Raspberry flavors are front and center in this young, light wine. It keeps the tart acids in proportion, and the palate is focused and well defined. The finish turns hard and tannic, but further bottle age should soften it up a bit.",89,20.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Swick
US,"This 100% varietal wine is spicy and succulent, with a touch of oak reduction on the nose that resolves as it opens. Big boned, it tastes dark cherry- and plum-driven, spiked with cinnamon and black pepper.",91,89.0,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt
France,"This is a lively, juicy wine. It shows the fruitiness of the vintage balanced with a sense of structure.

US,"Shows amazingly ripe fruit, offering a blast of pineapple jam, apricot, tangerine, papaya and lime flavors.

Spain,"Get at this wine while it's still fresh and you'll likely enjoy its pineapple, apple and mango essence.

US,"This high-end Cab is named after a deceased winery employee who would be pleased to have such a distinguished wine in his memory. It's very powerful and tannic and needs age, but it's also exceptionally balanced.

US,"Shows the rich, concentrated tannins associated with Mount Veeder, as well as the rich, ripe fruit. Oak stands out, with toasty caramel, as well as strong flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants. Yet the real star is the mouthfeel. It's fleshy and almost fatty and should develop in the bottle through 2013.",92,35.0,California,Mount Veeder,Merlot,Yates Family Vineyard
Argentina,"Sharp and tight on the nose, and then it stays narrow and rather punishing on the palate. It's a tangy, gritty, tough wine with tart red-fruit flavors and bitter coffee note on the finish. Malbec-Syrah-Tempranillo is the blend.",82,24.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Red Blend,Antigal
Spain,"This is the prototype for an over-the-top, roasted, charred Tempranillo. The nose smells directly of burnt coffee, charcoal and grilled beef. It's super-chunky on the tongue, with dominating roasted black fruit flavors. It has its merits but is still too blackened for our liking.",85,20.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,Tempranillo,Tritón

US,"As with the Avery Lane Merlot, this is a rather complex blend, here including Syrah, Cab Franc and Lemberger. Fruity and spicy, with strawberry and cherry candy flavors. Very pleasing picnic wine.",86,10.0,Washington,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon,Avery Lane
US,"A good Chardonnay to serve at parties, this shows plenty of oak-driven vanilla and toast flavors that ride high over the seemingly sweet note of pineapple candy. It will satisfy lots of Chardophiles, at an affordable price.",84,25.0,California,California,Chardonnay,Black Box
Italy,"This expression of Brunello from Tenute Silvio Nardi seems older than it really is. The wine offers elegant and ethereal nuances of resin, asphalt and black licorice backed by prunes and pine nuts. The tannins are firm and the wine ends with a dusty, dry feel.",88,24.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese Grosso,Tenute Silvio Nardi

US,"A blend of 80% Pinot Noir with 20% Chardonnay, this rosé sparkles in well-hewn acidity, a dry mix of white peach that's fruity and decadent in creamy waves of soft texture and yeasty bubbles. It finishes with length and breadth, an ideal match for the table.",91,24.0,California,Napa County,Sparkling Blend,Mumm Napa
US,"Pretty straightforward Cabernet, done well and blended with bits of Petit Verdot and Merlot. Vanilla, tobacco and cassis aromas mark the nose, while the flavors are similar, but with a slightly plummy edge. Soft and supple on the finish, there's no need to cellar this wine.",88,28.0,California,Livermore Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wente

US,"With 14% Gewürztraminer in the blend, and almost 2% residual sugar, this is a popular tasting-room wine. It's got a lightly pleasing streak of tea, and if you like a little lemon in your ice tea you'll like this wine. Clean and showing surprising length, it should be chilled down to boost its backbone.",87,9.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling,Hogue
Italy,"This is one of the most fruit-forward Amarones I have tasted from this vintage. The concentration and extraction is very good and the nose is richly redolent of plump black cherry, plum, blackberry and blueberry supported by shadings of chocolate, tar and caramel. Creamy succulence and a long, drying finish characterize the mouthfeel. Imported by Wine Wave.",90,38.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Vigneti Villabella

Spain,"There's not a region or grape type that Telmo Rodríguez won't tackle, and here he's on to Moscatel in the deep south. This wine exhibits lilac aromas with hints of smoked ham and hard cheese.

In addition, look for a bulky but rewarding palate featuring chewy sweet fruit and moderate acidity.",88,48.0,Andalucia,Málaga,Moscatel,Telmo Rodríguez
US,"Very Champagne-like in the nose, with earthy-yeasty aromas and underlying notes of citrus, smoke, and mineral. Pretty, inviting. In the mouth, great complexity.

There are baked, aged characteristics, and it finishes dry and long.",93,33.0,California,Anderson Valley,Champagne Blend,Pacific Echo

France,"With its soft tannins and slightly creamy texture, the open-knit 2006 Domaine de Roure is very approachable now.

A hint of oak allows for coffee and mocha to grace the modest finish.",87,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Rutini
Spain,"A fuller, more minty and deep Garnacha than Hughes' Lot 129. This has standup, standout aromas followed by deep berry fruit flavors.

Italy,"Guado dè Gemoli is a 80-20 blend of Cab Sauvignon and Merlot that is enhanced by elegant mineral and slate aromas backed by wild berry, cherry, leather, licorice and cherry cola.

US,"Released after five years on the yeast, this is still a young, tartly aggressive bubbly. It is in fact by far the most acidic of Iron Horse's current stable of superb bubblies. But it's enormously rich, offering a wealth of subtle lime, peach, strawberry, toast and sourdough bread flavors that impress with both depth and length, as well as sheer class. Wonderful now, and should age effortlessly for six to eight years.",93,37.0,California,Green Valley,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse
Argentina,"Dark, minty, inky aromas of blackberry are rugged. Same for the palate, which is pinched and rubbery, with grabby tannins.

A sensational wine to enjoy right now.",96,65.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Ken Wright

US,"Lots to like in this Cab. Few regions do a better job of ripening red wines than Paso Robles while keeping prices modest.

This is a good price for a Cab of this quality.",89,14.0,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon,Liberty School
Italy,"Here is a vivid and inviting rendition of Nero d'Avola that sees one year in oak casks and delivers layers of blueberry fruit, cigar box, almonds, spice and a hot sensation reminiscent of kirsch spirit.

It's potent in blackberry and black cherry fruit, with a spicy finish.",91,40.0,California,California,Syrah,Bella Victorian Vineyard

The wine could use more complexity but overall, is enjoyable and will be good with a variety of richer poultry and seafood dishes.",83,16.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay,Buttonwood Grove

US,"Offering none of the oaky, fruity richness of popular Chardonnays, this bottle needs to be figured out in a different way. It's super-dry, acidic and minerally, with citrus fruit flavors that seem barely touched by oak. It's a wine of structural integrity, made in the style of a great Chablis. One of the rare Chardonnays that should age.",92,35.0,California,Mount Veeder,Chardonnay,Mayacamas
US,"Hobo has a knack for taking Zinfandel's wild, briary personality and wrestling it to as much elegance as a Dry Creek Zin is capable of. True to form, Hobo accomplishes that. This wine has Zin's brambly spiciness, and never quite overcomes its rusticity, but it is likeable. The penetrating acidity makes it a fine partner with tomato saucy barbecued beef or chicken.",88,22.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel,Hobo
Italy,"With bold cherry, dusty earth and tobacco nearly blowing out of the glass, you get Brunello's aromas at their finest. Across the palate flows plum and offsetting pepper, while on the finish the wine gets tight as a drum courtesy of those patented fierce Brunello tannins. Very fruity but tight; drink 2005 or later.",92,97.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese,Conti Costanti

US,"They held this wine back nearly five years before releasing it, but it's still fiercely tannic. That's the main problem, and to judge by the fruit, which is entering a mature phase, the wine's future is in doubt.",84,25.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Merlot,Sarah's Vineyard
Italy,"Aromas of wild berry, floral notes and light spice shadings make for a very nice balance. The wine is tannic, dry and raw in the mouth. It should be paired with melted chèvre cheese on baguette.",87,24.0,Piedmont,Roero,Nebbiolo,Bricco del Prete
France,"Made from 60-year-old vines, evidenced by its concentration and serious ageability. It is structured, firm and relatively dry at this young stage. It's a wine that needs at least 5 years. Today, if you do open a bottle, watch for the mineral, stony character that pushes the fruit and demands attention.",93,85.0,Burgundy,Chassagne-Montrachet,Chardonnay,Domaine Bernard Moreau et Fils
Italy,"A carefully crafted wine that shares little in common with the Pinot Grigios we normally drink. The aromas and the mouthfeel are opulent and silky and the wine's solid structure is built for elaborate dishes. A Marc de Grazia Selection, various U.S. importers.",89,24.0,Northeastern Italy,Friuli Isonzo,Pinot Grigio,Vie di Romans

US,There's a pretty pink “eye of the partridge” color on this blush wine. Brisk acidity makes the finish clean and minerally. The strawberry and vanilla flavors finish just slightly off dry.,85,22.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sangiovese,Muscardini
Italy,"Leafy underbrush, truffle, new leather and dark berry aromas slowly take shape in the glass. The taut palate offers dried black cherry, clove, star anise and espresso notes, with tightly-wound, fine grained tannins that leave a firm finish.",90,55.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese,Camigliano
US,"There's no oak at all on this savory young Sauvignon Blanc, which delivers its richness directly to the palate, undiluted. Those flavors are of green fruits: melons, apples, limes and the slightly sour, flowery tang of gooseberries. Fine acidity makes it all brisk and mouthwatering. An outstanding Sauvignon Blanc for today's ethnic fare, at a great price.",90,14.0,California,Mendocino,Sauvignon Blanc,Husch
Spain,"Stripped-back cherry and raspberry flavors take on a jammy character with airing. This is tight, bright and mildly acidic on the palate, with raspberry, red plum and brown sugar flavors.

US,"I happened to taste this right after a Pinot that cost five times as much, and this one wasn't shamed. In fact, it stood up quite well. No, it didn't have the concentration, but the purity of fruit, crisp acids and silky texture make for a lovely Pinot Noir.",86,10.0,California,Central Coast,Pinot Noir,Meridian
France,"The Monts Damnés, the cursed hill because its steepness makes it so difficult to work, faces south-east and gives the ripest grapes. This rich wine exemplifies the richness of the wines from this vineyard. It is finely rounded, stylish and full of opulent fruitiness. All this is tempered by a tight, mineral texture that gives the wine a fine final bite. Drink from 2017.",94,59.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Delaporte
US,"Heavy, tannic and dense now, but clearly well-grown, this Bordeaux blend wants a little time in the cellar to knit together. An unusual blend of Malbec and Petit Verdot, it's rich and captivating in black currants and cassis, with a long, spicy finish. Shows masterful blending talent, combining grapes from the Alexander and Dry Creek valleys. Hold until after 2012.",90,28.0,California,Sonoma County,Red Blend,William Knuttel

US,"There's an interesting counterplay between the bright and the dark in Lovingston's hand-picked, small lot Josie's Knoll. On the nose, black cherry preserves are countered with black pepper spice and char. On the palate, ripe, concentrated black fruit is layered with tar, earth and bramble. It's elegant and seductive, but anchored by a core of gripping tannins.",87,15.0,Virginia,Monticello,Merlot,Lovingston
Italy,"Here's a beautifully ruby-colored wine with a sunny disposition and rich aromas of cherry, red flowers, almonds and minerals that is aged six months in French oak.

France,"From vines planted to the west of Chablis, this is a soft, ripe and fruity wine. It has some tension from the minerality while keeping the white fruit flavors to the fore.

France,"From an average red vintage in the Loire, this shows a tight, almost stalky character, its spice and fruitcake flavors cut with dry tannins and just an edge of green pepper. Not for aging, drink this year.",84,24.0,Loire Valley,Anjou,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,Domaine de Montgilet
US,"A dramatic Cabernet that shows Atlas Peak intensity and age-worthiness, this is bone dry, with hard tannins and zesty acidity. The core of blackberries, black currants and minerals is so delicious now, you can hardly keep from drinking it, but it will develop cellar complexity with 6–8 years of aging, and possibly far more.",94,40.0,California,Atlas Peak,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arger-Martucci

Italy,"It's great fun to revisit the stellar 1997 vintage and see that this Tuscan Cabernet has evolved so gracefully over the years. Aromas include white mineral, ash, licorice, dried flowers and measured tones of red cherry fruit. It makes for a delicate ensemble that is lean and a bit thorny in the mouth but still very satisfying.",91,24.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Cabernet Sauvignon,Falchini
Australia,"This light- to medium-weight wine features a bouquet of berry and earth aromas and mature Cabernet flavors. The wood doesn't overwhelm, but the mouthfeel is slightly prickly and astringent, and the fruit doesn't really sing. Closes with mild tobacco notes.",83,12.0,Australia Other,South Eastern Australia,Cabernet Sauvignon,Wyndham Estate
US,"This is the second vintage for Saggi, the newest Long Shadows collaboration, this one with Tuscany's Ambrogio and Giovanni Folonari.

This expression opens with bright tones of white peach, citrus, honey and a drying mineral note at the back.",88,24.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Etna,White Blend,Tenuta delle Terre Nere
US,"Don't let the price tag fool you; this is a sophisticated blend with Merlot, Cab Franc, Malbec and Syrah comprising a quarter of the total.

Just a hint of chocolate malt hits in the finish.",87,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau Ste. Michelle
US,"The Camaspelo—a 67% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 8% Cab Franc blend—is a little bigger, a little thicker in the mouth than the Flying Pig, but with similar fruit and grip.

Still very young, but with exceptional aging potential.",94,65.0,Oregon,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Cayuse
US,"Sound and dry, but heavy and dull, and not quite ripe. There's a vegetal component to the blackberries and oak.",83,39.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Syrah,Big Basin
France,"The granite soil of the Lindenberg vineyard produces a wine that is steely, tight, packed with as much acidity and mineral texture as fruit. It has layers of acidity and fruit over this firm, young structure. This complex wine needs to age, so drink from 2017.",89,20.0,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling,Henri Schoenheitz
US,"While initially quite smoky and closed, time and aeration coax bright, cheery black plum and cherry flavors from this boldly structured wine.

Subtleties of bramble and spice add elegance.",89,25.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Sauvignon,Damiani

Spain,"Dusty toffee and dried stone-fruit aromas are pure and inviting. This is ultra crisp and fresh, with ripping acidity.

This is a classic complex amontillado purchased from the cellar of Manuel Cuevas Jurado.",92,30.0,Andalucia,Jerez,Sherry,Lustau

Drink now.",91,45.0,California,Calaveras County,Red Blend,Twisted Oak

France,"A commanderie was a castle erected by the Knights Templar in the Middle Ages. The vineyard based around this fortress has produced a soft rounded wine that has great balance between fruit and acidity. It is stylish wine, light while having plenty of red fruits. Drink now.",88,22.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,Rosé,Chateau Peyrassol
US,"Made in a forward, approachable style, this Cab has succulent flavors of red currants, cherry liqueur, plums, chocolate and a hint of savory wintergreen. The tannins are thick and young, but very fine and sweet, with no trace of unripeness. Great with a charbroiled steak.",90,90.0,California,St. Helena,Cabernet Sauvignon,Crocker & Starr
Italy,"This 100% Sangiovese bottling serves up a textbook Chianti bouquet of black cherries, leather and earth. The same range, with good fruit focus, shows on the flavorful palate, with its dense, chewy texture. Fine, well-structured tannins indicate that this should improve over the next three years and age well.",89,30.0,Tuscany,Tuscany,Sangiovese,Villa Cafaggio
US,"A good everyday Merlot, dry and rich in tannins, with pleasant cherry, cocoa, licorice, herb and spice flavors.",84,4.0,California,California,Merlot,Bandit
France,"Quite a lean wine, austerely tannic. The wood element is prominent and lends an extra dryness to the wine. It is, finally, hard-edged, with the acidity somewhat bitter.",85,24.0,Bordeaux,Margaux,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Deyrem Valentin
France,The Malbec in the blend adds its tannins to this wine meant to drink young. The spice and wood aging are balanced with acidity and a juicy aftertaste. Drink from late 2016.,85,10.0,Southwest France,Bergerac,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Bélingard
Argentina,"A cool quality runs through the dark-fruit bouquet, which has notes of leather and earth in reserve. The palate is forward and fruity, and it settles on the finish with a touch of plushness and a little chocolate flavor. Straightforward, and with some depth. This is a nice Argentine Tempranillo that happens to be organic.",87,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Tempranillo,Santa Julia
US,"This is fresh, tannic and full bodied, and it offers deep flavors of blackberries and cassis. Worth cellaring, this should begin to resolve by 2017.",94,42.0,California,Oak Knoll District,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tudal
US,"This is locked up tight upon opening; plan on giving it a good couple of hours in the decanter. Peppery and firm, the compact berry, cherry and plum fruit shows a touch of leather in the nose. The addition of Cabernet seems to mute the brightness of the Syrah.",89,34.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Red Blend,Doyenne
US,"This wine is so loaded with glycerine, it actually pours slow from the bottle, like honey. With 17.4 grams of residual sugar, it's decadently, deliriously sweet, but sugar is not its only charm. There's a fabulous flood of apricots, pineapples, peaches and limes, concentrated to their essence and geléed, enriched with pure vanilla and clover honey and dusted with cinnamon. Doesn't that sound good?",95,45.0,California,Alexander Valley,White Riesling,Arrowood
Italy,"Nanerone opens with an inky, black color and jammy aromas of strawberry jam, dried prune, raisin, blackberry pie and some light shadings of sweet Christmas spice. It drinks like maple syrup—it's sweet, thick and heavy in the mouth.",83,35.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Aleatico,Piandibugnano
Argentina,"The bouquet is floral and lightly jammy, with berry aromas and a savory note or two. Turns a touch soupy and salty in the mouth, where the red fruit flavors thin out quickly. Finishes without much punch, but at least it's solid.",85,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Bonarda,Ksana
US,"An exotic, dry and crisp Chardonnay, with plenty of toasty oak. Shows a mélange of dried orange, pineapple and pear fruit, with a minerally note. There's a feral quality that may be the result of native yeasts. Drink now.",87,20.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay,Old World
US,"Coal black, this no-holds-barred Syrah is for those who love the dark side of the grape. Flavors of smoked cherries fill the palate, which is dense and tannic. At the core is a mesh of bark, earth and graphite, but the wine retains its balance with the perfect mix of ripe tannins and natural acidity.",90,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Syrah,Stevens

France,"Don't tell the appellation contrôlée police, but this is 100% Viognier (not technically permitted under the Côtes-du-Rhône Villages AC), harvested late with ridiculously low yields, then barrel-fermented and -aged. The result is like liquified buttered nuts, honey and dried apricots. Or maybe it's melted orange marmalade, without the sugar. Only made in occasional vintages, this is a treat.",90,62.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône Villages,Viognier,Château Saint Esteve d'Uchaux
Italy,"Round and full-bodied, with a touch of prune to the otherwise foresty nose. Tastes a bit cooked, but not enough to be a detractor. Beyond that, the plum, raisin and black-cherry flavors are deep and satisfying. Finishes expectedly rich, but with structure.

US,"Named in honor of North Carolina's first commercial winery and a woman born in the 1500s in the Lost Colony of Roanoke, this white is floral in kumquat and toffee, a mix of rich and robust that's tropical in personality. Tangy acidity closes out the finish, revealing the toasty oak it inhabited for a year.",86,25.0,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay,Virginia Dare
France,"91-93 Barrel sample. Definite wood aromas, the fruit buried under the high toast flavors. This gives dryness as well as extract. The wine comes across hard, tight, almost dark in character.",92,24.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Canon
US,"Pretty good; a New World-style wine marked by excessive softness and ripeness and delicious, pie-filling flavors, although it's fully dry. Cherries, milk chocolate and root beer dominate, wrapped in soft tannins and acids. Syrah, Grenache, Carignan, Petite Sirah and Alicante Bouschet.",85,40.0,California,Monterey County,Rhône-style Red Blend,Joseph Phelps
US,"Like the '01, this beautifully structured wine is supple and racy, with tart zippy fruit. It shows classic Washington berry flavors, with cassis, bright acid and a hint of licorice.

US,"Anderson Valley is one of the best homes to the aromatic whites in California, as evidenced once again by this dry, delicately structured Alsatian-style Gewürz. It's not a strong wine, but a lively, crisp one, with polished citrus, peach, apple, floral and spice flavors.",85,14.0,California,Anderson Valley,Gewürztraminer,Husch

Spain,"Dry and smooth, with balsam and cedar aromas wrapped around controlled fruit scents and toast. The wine is ripe and balanced, with hickory flavors adding a barbecued angle to the steady palate. Firm, structured and tasting of clove and woodspice on the finish. Drink now through 2011.",90,19.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo Blend,Solabal
France,"Soft, ripe and balanced, this is already a delicious wine. The grapefruit edge to the fruit gives it considerable freshness, but there are also flavors of white fruits, just leavened by toast. To finish, the acidity just bounces out of the glass.",91,110.0,Burgundy,Meursault,Chardonnay,Morey-Blanc
US,"Big, oaky and extremely bright, with refreshing acids and crisply defined fruit. As is usually the case with this spectacular vineyard, the flavors carry extra intensity; they seem to drill down into the heart of the palate. Though released young, this is a wine that could certainly benefit from another 6–12 months in the bottle.",90,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay,Chateau Ste. Michelle
Argentina,"High Note is a dark, extracted type of Malbec with intense color, robust black fruit aromas and a rich, deep palate with core acidity and then monstrous, sweet berry flavors along the edges. It's hefty, fat and saturated, but also sweet and jammy. Delivers quantity and volume for the price.",86,10.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Malbec,High Note
France,"The aroma shows old wood flavors that don't work. On the palate, the wood also gives some bitterness that needs to disappear to bring out the best of the red fruits. It's probably always going to be on the hard side.",86,24.0,Burgundy,Nuits-St.-Georges,Pinot Noir,L. Tramier & Fils
Italy,"This dessert wine offers elegant, light buoyancy and clean harmony overall. You'll get fragrances of honey, chamomile, yellow rose, marzipan and white peach.

It's fruit flavor is met with plenty of kick and grab. Can age for a year.",87,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trivento
US,"Wet slate minerality leads the brisk, tightly wound nose. On the palate, the wine is a bit perfumed, at least for how tight the nose is, with elements of crisp apple, pear and a touch of nectarine.",87,45.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay,Testarossa
US,"Tastes classically young and in need of cellaring, with gigantic, dry tannins and a fresh-fruit directness that hasn't meshed yet with the oak barrel influences. Give it until at least 2012, and it should hold for years after.",87,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Petite Sirah,Envy
US,"Bombastic and burly, this wine holds a depth of black raspberry and cherry at its edge, surrounded in swathes of smoky oak. Rich and full bodied, it is a testament to the intrigue of baking spices and black tea, but more significantly to dark chocolate and espresso.",89,39.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Sonoma-Loeb

US,"Brilliant; defines cool-climate terroir. Hard to exaggerate the deliciousness of the cherries, raspberries, cola, licorice, gingersnap cookie, sweet oak, vanilla and spice flavors.

Italy,"Smoky elements of roasted nut combined with jammy fruit make for an offbeat aromatic assembly. This is a raw, chewy wine with a dense, plush mouthfeel that needs a year or two to fully integrate.",86,24.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti Superiore,Barbera,Cascina Castlet
US,"In France, this would be a vin de pays. It's a simple little country wine, dry and bracing, with good cherry-berry flavors and a rich earthiness. It'll be fine with a grilled flank steak you might even find yourself reaching for a third glass.",85,11.0,California,California,Syrah,Heron
US,"Here's Parker's basic county bottling. It's a rustic wine, rough and jagged in tannins and a little heavy, with cherry jam and oak flavors. Could soften and improve in a year or two.",83,25.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Pinot Noir,Fess Parker
Argentina,"Forward and simple, with red fruit and citrus on the nose. The palate is lean and light bodied, with tangy, dry red fruit flavors, orange and sour sucking candy. Quite tangy on the finish, and overall it achieves only a certain level of weight and prominence. No oak.",83,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Pinot Noir,Nieto Senetiner

Spain,"With basic pear, green melon and other sweet aromas, the nose is controlled. But the palate on this white Garnacha is dry and soda-like, with seltzer-like flavors touched up by citrus. Decent but bland. Imported by Frontier Wine Imports.",83,20.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,Garnacha,Viñedos y Bodegas Pablo

US,"Refined and inviting, the bouquet offers caramel, hazelnuts and toast. Dark apple, toast, spice and earth flavors fill the mouth. The mouthfeel is rich and dense, though a touch more fruit would really have it singing. Finishes with spice and faint lime notes, and a toasty oak flavor that really takes over. The former Deutz Champagne estate in San Luis Obispo County, Laetitia is now devoted to producing Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.",89,33.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Chardonnay,Laetitia
France,"You can tell this is going to be sweet by its gold color. And there's no deception, except along with that sweetness there is a surprising (and delightful) freshness, which comes from sweet apple juice acidity. The toffee is more obvious than the honey, but this remains a fresh, vivid wine.",92,24.0,Loire Valley,Coteaux du Layon,Chenin Blanc,Domaine Philippe Delesvaux

Argentina,"Thick and chewy, this Cabernet is all Argentine in its weight and character. It feels full, with candied, creamy dark-fruit flavors that are backed by caramel and spice notes.

Finishes warm, tight and spicy.",88,19.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo Blend,Marques de Tomares
US,"This Merlot straddles that interesting line between easy, everyday drinking and real complexity. It's dry and richly tannic, and is the sort of wine that won't win a blind tasting, but leaves you reaching for a third glass with that steak.",87,16.0,California,Sonoma County,Merlot,Arrowood
US,"A spectacular Pinot, continuing a string of great vintages from this little vineyard. The year 2007 gave California supernaturally rich but balanced Pinot Noirs, and this is one of them. It's sensational, offering broad, exotic fruit flavors, pinpointed with exotic spices, and exquisitely highlighted with French oak. Truly fine, this small-production wine should age over the next 6–8 years.",97,75.0,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Noir,Goldeneye
US,"Delicious and compelling 100% Cabernet from this great vintage. Shows classically developed, sweet Napa tannins and wonderfully ripe fruit. As expressive as the blackberries and currants are, they're reined in with minerals and herbs to produce exquisite tension. Best now, with a good decant, and should develop for many years.",94,55.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Parallel

Spain,"Zesty, edgy red berry aromas are bright, scratchy and sweet. The palate is healthy, balanced and creamy, with juicy, slightly candied flavors of red berry fruits and herbs. Creamy and round but balanced. Shows the good side Cariñena at a fair price; 60% Garnacha and 40% Syrah.",87,10.0,Northern Spain,Cariñena,Grenache-Syrah,Torito Bravo
US,"A blend of two great vineyards, Shadow Canyon and Laetitia, this wine is notable for its delicacy and charm. But that doesn't mean it's wimpy. It's tremendously rich in cherry preserves, kirsch, cassis and spices, but maintains a crisp balance and freshness. Very fine and dry finish.",93,30.0,California,San Luis Obispo County,Syrah,Herman Story
US,"Young and fresh, this Pinot stars ripe, primary fruit flavors of raspberries and cherries, and lots of zingy acidity. It's jammy and sweet, like the filling from a fruit pie or tart. Delicious, but lacking a certain seriousness. May develop bottle complexity over the next several years.",87,36.0,California,Mendocino Ridge,Pinot Noir,Drew

Kirsch, cherry, raspberry and cinnamon combine to make the wine invitingly lush and plush.",91,65.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Eleven Eleven
US,"With this bottling Goldschmidt runs with the big Oakville dogs. Classic, a dry, tremendously concentrated and oaky Cab with massive flavors of blackberry tart, cassis, anise, cocoa and cedar.

The source is a tiny vineyard west of the Silverado Trail.",96,150.0,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon,Goldschmidt

US,"This bottling from young winemaker Michael Miroballi shows lime blossom, chalk, fresh rain on concrete and nectarine flesh on the nose. The palate is exuberant with flavors but they're not ripe, instead showing lime peels and juice, a cement-like grip and a buzzing sensation that overtakes the mouth like a Sichuan peppercorn.",92,25.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Grenache Blanc,Miroballi Wines

Spain,"This is mellow upfront, but it also has solid plum and berry aromas. On the palate it's grabby but good, with tough tannins that support dark plum and savory notes.

Dried herbs add a nice grace note, but the finish brings a darker, roasted character that turns slightly burnt and bitter.",85,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Rhône-style Red Blend,Kana
US,"The last few vintages of this wine have been variable. This one plays it safe, going right down the middle in delivering blackberry, peppered steak and new oak flavors. It's a little on the soft side, suggesting that it's ready to drink now.",89,38.0,California,Napa Valley,Syrah,Four Cairn
Australia,"In the heat of the 2008 vintage, it may have been a mistake to further dry 20% of the grapes for this wine. The result has turned out chocolaty-ripe, but also with a touch of raisining evident, and while there's volume, there's also a certain lack of midpalate richness.",83,23.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,Cabernet Sauvignon,Mitolo
US,"A blend of fruit from three Rogue Valley sites, this is a fine example of the style of Pinot made in Southern Oregon. The estate vineyard sits at 2,100 feet on a steep, east-facing slope, with densely planted vines. It's a big, blocky, full-bodied wine, loaded with flavors of black cherry, black coffee and barrel toast. Tannins are substantial, but the flavors are full and forward. What it lacks in elegance it makes up for in immediate likeability.",89,35.0,Oregon,Oregon,Pinot Noir,Irvine Family Vineyards
Argentina,"A gritty but well-made wine with aromas of crushed brick, red pepper flake, earth and sandalwood.

France,"Young, very crisp wine, definitely in the bright acidity style of sparkling wine, its fruits going towards currants, with a final grapefruit citrus element. It does need a few more months' bottle age to lose its complete emphasis on acidity.",87,18.0,Loire Valley,Crémant de Loire,Sparkling Blend,Château Moncontour

More bottle age may help to soften the oak flavors.",88,42.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Foundry Vineyards
US,"This bottling from Lost Canyon is one of California's best-kept Syrah secrets. Year after year, it's a rich, tannic, dramatically structured wine of impressive depth and deliciousness.

US,"Accented with intriguing notes of charred oak, dried herbs, porcini mushrooms and a whisper of peppery grains of paradise, this is a rustic Merlot.

US,"Enormously rich and ripe, with waves of blackberries, cherries, licorice, chocolate and cedary oak influences. Feels dry and lush in the mouth, but very tannic, giving a sandpapery astringency.

Spain,"One sniff gives you all the info needed to process this as a terrific modern Rioja. It's rich, cuddly, oaky and minty, with tons of spice and black fruit. The palate is juicier than in the past, with lively black cherry, cassis, tobacco, vanilla and mocha flavors. Yet another fine Nieta from the Eguren family. Drink now through 2018.",93,164.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
France,Excellent color on this firmly fruity wine. It has an attractive edge of tannins giving it good structure while showing all of the fresh nouveau fruit.,86,12.0,Beaujolais,Beaujolais,Gamay,Antonin Rodet
US,"This shows an evident layer of oak in the form of buttered toast and vanilla notes, but the underlying wine is strong in pineapple and golden mango flavors. Fine coastal acidity and a hint of mineral provide structural balance.",91,23.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay,Gainey
Italy,"Off the charts in almost every way. First, it's a Calabrian Chardonnay with tons of hangtime and oak. Second, it hardly resembles Chardonnay as we know it. The nose is oily, with lemon, baked corn and quince. The palate is custardy, ultra ripe and borderline over the top. Finishes in complex ways, with peach, apricot and nutmeg along with white pepper. More of a sommelier/explorer's wine.",89,36.0,Southern Italy,Val di Neto,Chardonnay,Azienda Agricola Roberto Ceraudo Strongoli
US,"Chuck Reininger has fashioned a Merlot that captures his personal style as well as the signature of the vineyards. Smooth and seamless, juiced up with spicy berry and plum, then softened with barrel flavors of butterscotch, milk chocolate and coffee, this wine just glides along on a carpet of silk, tossing out bursts of spice and herb along the way.",91,36.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Merlot,Reininger
US,"A hard wine to like. It's acidic and raisiny, and despite the official alcohol reading of 14.7%, tastes far higher, with a hot, chile pepper burn.",82,16.0,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Zinfandel,Amador Foothill Winery
US,"Tastes uneven, with sweet, jammy cherry and blackberry flavors side by side with minty, green ones. Rustic, but at this price, it's okay for a big party.",82,8.0,California,California,Zinfandel,Redtree
Spain,"Burnt rubber and a certain stemmy, roasted character is draped over the nose and palate. It has a decent, normal feel to it but the flavors of strawberry and raspberry are herbal and burnt. Tastes and smells rubbery and not fully clean.",82,9.0,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,Tempranillo,Bodegas Navarro López
Italy,"Dusty mineral tones are in line with aromatic white flowers, crisp green apple and almond skin. A festive and seductive nose opens onto fruit candy flavors and a tart, crisp endnote. Imported by Villa Italia.",87,21.0,Veneto,Prosecco di Valdobbiadene,Prosecco,Ruggeri & C.
US,"A good, sound Cabernet, well-made and clean, with proper varietal flavors of blackberries, cocoa and smoky new oak. Yet it's somewhat soft, with a jammy-candy taste, and seems to lack complexity. Could be going through an awkward phase.",86,60.0,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon,La Jota Vineyard
France,"Mineral, firm wine, although at the same time it has plenty of black plum fruits surrounding the core of dark tannins. The resulting wine is one that manages to combine the structure of Cahors while bringing out a fruity character.",89,14.0,Southwest France,Cahors,Malbec,Lionel Osmin & Cie
US,"A delicious Pinot Noir to drink now with upscale fare. It's very fruity, offering a burst of raspberries and cherries, together with a coat of sweet, smoky oak. But crisp acidity and smooth, silky tannins provide a balanced structure.",90,17.0,California,Monterey County,Pinot Noir,J. Lohr
US,"Fresh and fruity, this elegant Cab is supported by smaller percentages of Malbec and Petit Verdot. Firm tannins and a low imprint of oak allow the cinnamon-dusted black cherry and cassis to speak, girded by a fine structure and peppery finish.",92,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Flora Springs
US,"Stylish and tight, with compact flavors of cassis, black cherry and berry in a wrap of baby fat. This muscular Cab has the toasty joie de vivre of a new Bordeaux, without all the herbal stuff. New (as of 2003) winemaker Kevin Mott seems to have solved the issues that were creating severely reduced, hard-as-nails wines in recent vintages.",91,44.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Woodward Canyon
Spain,"Aromas of pure cherry are pointed but clean. That more or less describes the wine, which hits with sharp acidity but also good, slightly roasted flavors of cherry and plum. Finishes short, firm and a touch grating.",85,10.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,Red Blend,Bodegas Vinos de León
US,"A nice example of the '08 Pinots, just coming out, and the price is fair for a wine of this quality.

Drink now.",90,25.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Hook & Ladder
Spain,"Not all of the new wines that we see from up and coming regions like Montsant are good. This one is a lean, burnt and minty offering with an odd baked, nutty character. Not up to standards.",81,30.0,Catalonia,Montsant,Red Blend,Portal del Montsant
US,"Though it's plushly textured and even and supple on the tongue, the flavors are woody rather than fruit-driven, with dried-spice nuances. Finishes dry, with cherry and chocolate notes and mouth-coating tannins.",89,56.0,California,Napa Valley,Merlot,Sterling
Italy,"This impressive Rosso offers lush aromas of rum cake, coffee, spice, pipe tobacco and dark fruit. It shows warm, earthy or leathery notes in the mouth that are rounded off by fresh Sangiovese acidity.",90,15.0,Tuscany,Rosso di Montalcino,Sangiovese Grosso,Caprili
Italy,"A blend of Sangiovese and 20% Canaiolo, it conveys spicy aromas of black pepper, spearmint and toast. The palate delivers black berry and cherry alongside bright acidity. Simple but well-made, it would pair well with hearty pasta dishes.",86,22.0,Tuscany,Rosso di Montepulciano,Red Blend,La Calonica
US,"The Pellegrini style seems to emphasize extraction. That's great-up to a point. In this wine, the slightly weedy cassis fruit adequately balances the starching tannins, yielding an age-worthy wine that should develop for up to 10 years.",88,29.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Pellegrini Vineyards

Spain,"Aalto is one of several smaller projects being led by former Vega Sicilia head winemaker Mariano García, and we think this 2001 Pagos Seliccionados (PS) is his best effort to date. The wine is dark, with charcoal, lemon and pure black-fruit aromas. It features a brilliant luster and deep, rich, syrupy flavors of maple, boysenberry and black cherry. Shows a beautiful finish and amazing depth. Hold until 2006–07.",95,105.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Tinto del Pais,Aalto

US,"Hard to explain why this Cabernet is so good at such an affordable price, but there you are. It's dry, smooth and complex in blackberry, black currant, mineral and oak flavors that are a joy to drink now with your best beef dish. Easy to find, with almost 31,000 cases produced.",90,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Decoy
US,"Herbal flavors descend into stemminess, with the aggressive tannins swamping the fruit. The finish is hard, earthy and tasting of green tea.",86,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Belle Vallée
France,"There's been an evolution taking place at this house, with new oak no longer ubiquitous in the offerings. In fact, this wine is aged solely in concrete, which allows charming hints of lavender and thyme to shine among the cherry and cocoa notes. It's full-bodied yet firm, so pair it with burgers or steaks off the grill.",88,21.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône Villages,Grenache-Syrah,Tardieu-Laurent

US,"Vine Cliff is in the serious Cabernet business, crafting Cabs that aim for early drinkability but long ageability. The '04 is a success. It may lack the extra edge for profundity, but is delicious now for its oaky flavors of black currants, cassis, plums and mocha. Yet such are the tannins and acids that it should easily negotiate the next ten years, if not longer.",91,75.0,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon,Vine Cliff
US,"The dryness and length of this Pinot Noir make it especially recommendable. It just feels lush and important in the mouth, offering a wealth of cherry, raspberry, currant, mocha and spice flavors, with a meaty note of beef jerky. Should develop for a good six years in the bottle.",93,44.0,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Noir,Rockroom Winemaking Cooperative
Argentina,"Starts out with ripe dark-druit aromas, while pepper and charred beef come later. The palate is best up front, where black cherry and dark berry flavors attack well but lose steam fairly quickly. And the finish holds onto some buttery oak that one might rather not taste. But overall this is an easy 50-50 Argentine red blend.",86,13.0,Other,San Juan,Shiraz-Malbec,Bodegas Peñaflor
France,"A big, fruity bold wine, packed with the ripest fruit, concentrated and complex, with room for tight acidity.

US,"This is a luxuriously fruity wine to drink now with fancy beef dishes. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, it shows a juicy softness framing blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. Give it an hour in the decanter to aerate and develop.",91,55.0,California,Alexander Valley,Meritage,Rodney Strong

France,"With the extra year of maturity, this is turning into a toast and spice wine, with the citrus fruit now softening into ripe apples and peaches. The acidity remains, giving a satisfactory jolt of final freshness. The wine's name means girl from Chaudoux, a small village near Sancerre.",91,33.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,Sauvignon Blanc,Fournier Père et Fils

The finish is especially rewarding, lasting through a long, spicy aftertaste. Drink now.",89,45.0,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,Bouchaine
Italy,"This is a luscious and delicious Sauvignon with pungent tones of passion fruit, fresh mango, exotic fruit, sage, tomato leaf and lingering lime.

Wiemer
Italy,"Black licorice, cola and cherry liqueur open the nose and segue to black currant and crème de cassis aromas, then forest floor, bramble and Spanish cedar. This wine is linear, crisp and tight on the palate, with firm tannins. Give the wine five more years to soften.",91,70.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese Grosso,Tenute Silvio Nardi
US,"A solid Pinot Noir for its price, this offers all the expected flavors and strikes a balance between richness and freshness. Wild cherry, anise, sagebrush and slate aromas lead into a palate that packs ripe red fruit upfront, followed by tangy elderberry, plum skin, hibiscus and rose. A touch of elderflower adds depth.",91,30.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Noir,Gainey
Australia,"The Nine Stones line of regional Shiraz bottlings do taste distinctly different. This McLaren Vale offering features earthy, almost root vegetable-like aromas and flavors, plus cola and peppery spice. The tannins are soft, but the acids are crisp, imparting a lemony quality to the finish. Drink now.",86,14.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,Shiraz,Nine Stones
US,"This is a very big Pinot Noir, proudly showing off its muscles. Few Pinots anywhere achieve this depth of fruit. It floods the palate with the essence of raspberry and cherry, while plenty of new French oak brings even richer notes of toast and butterscotch. Despite the richness, it has a keen, silky vibrance. Although it is fine and impressive, it needs 5–6 years to knit together, settle down and get a little earthy.",94,75.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir,Joseph Phelps
Spain,"Big and bold stuff from southern Spain with burnt, hot aromas of roasted black fruits and stems. Better on the palate, where it brings plum and berry flavors but also some heat and saline. Slightly stemmy and roasted on the finish, much like the bouquet.",84,9.0,Levante,Jumilla,Monastrell,Bodegas Mähler-Besse
Italy,"New leather, truffle, sun-baked soil, menthol and grilled herb aromas practically jump out of the glass. The big, chewy palate delivers mature wild cherry, black raspberry, licorice and tobacco notes, set against a backdrop of firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2020–2027.",93,55.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese,Col d'Orcia
US,"A brilliant wine. Racy in acidity, silky in texture, yet powerful, it exudes the essence of Pinot Noir's greatness. Shows great fruity ripeness in the cherry, Dr. Pepper cola, licorice and bacon flavors, and also a wild, forest quality of grilled mushrooms, thyme and fennel. Absolutely dry, with a firm spine of tannins, the structure is near perfect. A divine expression of Hirsch, and a good candidate for six years in the cellar.",97,72.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"This is a blend of almost every white grape that grows in the county. Riesling brings a floral note to the citrus zest, apricot, tangerine and sweet herb flavors. The wine is unoaked, but very rich.",87,20.0,California,San Luis Obispo County,White Blend,Tangent
France,"This rich, full-bodied wine is packed with ripe, dense blackberry and plum flavors. With firm tannins in the background, it is always going to be dark and solid.

It's concentrated while still showing such wonderfully pure fruit. The aging potential is immense.",99,2300.0,Bordeaux,Pauillac,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Latour
US,"A gigantic Chardonnay. What it lacks in subtlety it more than makes up for in sheer power. Dazzles with pineapple jam, mango, pear, lime, buttered toast and sweet oak flavors, balanced with fine acidity. There's a minerally stoniness that makes it even more complex. Drink now–2014.",94,50.0,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay,Williams Selyem

US,"Michael Mondavi's Folio Fine Wine Partners now offers an Oregon Pinot Noir, this one vinified by Rob Mondavi, a fourth- generation winemaker. Pale and elegantly styled, it shows refined winemaking skills and a European sensibility. Pungently herbal, this supple wine brings young fruit flavors of cranberry and raspberry, but shows ageworthy depth and persistence. It's the sort of subtle, classic style that rewards both time and attention.",89,35.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,I'M

US,"Austere and slightly sweaty when first opened, this wine grudgingly displays its black fruits. There is a not-unpleasant metallic note, and spicy toast comes out in the finish. Very young and tight—decanting is highly recommended.",89,35.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Pinot Noir,Seven of Hearts
France,"Robust, full and nicely structured with good acidity and medium tannins, this red offers up loads of jammy raspberry and blueberry with accents of carnation and mocha.

France,"From the Roux family's own vines in Vougeot, this is an intense statement of dark tannins and firm fruit. The wine sits solidly in the glass, giving a dry core, surrounded by sweet plum juice flavors. In 5–6 years, it will have developed well.",91,24.0,Burgundy,Vougeot,Pinot Noir,Roux Père et Fils
France,"The richness of this wine comes through on from the ripe, supersweet fruits. It's beginning to mellow, with honey and sweet nuts showing more than the primary white fruits. The aftertaste gives crispness and a light freshness.",89,10.0,Loire Valley,Coteaux du Layon,Chenin Blanc,Château de Montguéret
US,"Very ripe and exotically delicious, with extravagant flavors of red cherry pie filling, raspberry caramel, vanilla custard and smoky oak flavors that are as rich as a pastry dessert. Fortunately, the wine is thoroughly dry. But it's hot in alcohol, and too soft to age, so drink now.",88,45.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir,La Rochelle
US,"Lots to admire in this lush Pinot, but also a major flaw. The flavors are deliciously upfront, all cherry pie, blackberry tart, blueberry, milk chocolate, gingerbread, caramel, vanilla and toast. But flavor isn't everything. The wine needs structure, more acidity, more tannins, something for the palate to grab on to.",85,48.0,California,Edna Valley,Pinot Noir,Stephen Ross
US,"A masterpiece it may be, but right now, in its precocious youth, it's all jammy fruit and smoky oak. But what jam! What oak! Tastes rich and compellingly good, like being swept away on a tidal wave of blackberry essence and cocoa. Very good, very rich, very fine, but you want to stash it away for a few years to let the parts meld.",93,70.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hall
US,"An interesting wine that aims high. It's good and elegant, but doesn't quite succeed in its aspirations or price. The cherry and vanilla oak flavors aren't rich enough to stand up to the hard, astringent tannins. Doesn't seem like an ager.",86,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Franc,Constant
Italy,This is a mineral-driven sparkler with a dusty quality that keeps the nose clean and simple. Those ashen notes give the wine a direct linear character and the texture in the mouth is very thin and streamlined.,86,15.0,Veneto,Prosecco del Veneto,Prosecco,Ruggeri & C.
Italy,"This offers aromas of pressed rose, cherry marinated in spirits, aromatic herb and menthol. The bracing palate shows raw red cherry, clove, white pepper and a hint of mocha while assertive tannins and racy acidity provide the framework. It's still young and aggressively tannic so don't attempt before 2019.",89,115.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Borgogno
US,"A problematic wine. It's too tannic and closed to enjoy now, and the fruit flavor may not be powerful enough to withstand aging. Then there's the sweaty taste that provides a jarring note, and may be tamping down the fruit.",85,90.0,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pine Ridge
US,"This is a wine that's been tremendously variable over the years, but with the '07, Craig has produced his best bottling since the late 1990s.

Drink now and for the next few years.",92,48.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Robert Craig
US,"This is a little gem, perfectly capturing the mix of flower, body powder, citrus and stone that only Gewürztraminer can evoke. Graceful and elegant, it spreads evenly across the palate and slides down the back of the throat.

US,"Showing the depth and nuance that mark great Chardonnay, this benefitted from its chilly location in the Petaluma Gap in this hot vintage. The coolness allowed the grapes to achieve maximally ripe tropical fruit, nectarine and peach flavors, while preserving vital acidity.

US,"The name plays on the fact that the winery owners are in the legal profession. It's a blend is a fine value, capturing the rugged, juicy quality of Barrister's vintage wines, and smoothing out some rougher tannins with a little extra time in bottle. The tannins are in fact rough, but justice is ultimately served, as this excellent value should be.",87,19.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend,Barrister

A great seafood wine.",88,8.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sauvignon Blanc,Columbia Crest
US,"Seriously deep, the weight and concentration immediately apparent, this Hyland Pinot requires extra breathing time, and probably some years in the cellar.

Spain,"Oddly, this is preferable to El Nido's $140 Cab-heavy fruit bomb. Maybe that's because Monastrell is the go-to grape in Jumilla, and this is 70% Monastrell and only 30% Cab compared to the opposite with El Nido.

France,"Bold and ripe, this is packed with red fruits and fresh acidity from an 85% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Franc blend. While the tannins are present, they have a walk-on part, leaving the stage for the rich and juicy fruits. That makes it a wine to drink soon, from 2016.",88,12.0,Bordeaux,Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château le Peyrat
US,"Easily one of the greatest California Merlots ever. Notable for its complete balance. Nothing sticks out; all the parts work together. The black cherry, plum, black currant, dark chocolate and licorice fruit is big, but perfectly balanced with smoky, sweet oak, while a subtle touch of violets brings a smack of the earth. The tannin-acid structure is just beautiful. Will continue to develop bottle complexity for at least six more years.",96,90.0,California,Sonoma County,Merlot,Chateau St. Jean
Argentina,"A power-packed blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Merlot that offers mossy aromas, earth and lush black fruit scents. The palate is lively yet balanced, with saturated wild berry, toast, anise and pepper flavors. Dark, toasted and showing licorice on the finish. A little hot and aggressive, so drink in late 2010 through 2012.",90,20.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Andeluna
US,"Notes of smoke, toast, lime and herbs play against guava, pear and brown sugar scents in the bouquet. A chalk note accents zesty orange, grapefruit and guava flavors and a soft mouthfeel. Vanilla, clove and oak highlights mark the wine's creamy, medium-length finish.",89,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay,Monticello Vineyards
Australia,"This full-bodied, fleshy Shiraz weighs in at a hefty 16% alcohol, but don't let that put you off. For the near term, it's a delicious bowl of mixed berries dressed up with elegant accents of smoke, toast, vanilla and mocha that hide the alcohol well. Drink now-2015.",92,50.0,South Australia,Padthaway,Shiraz,Henry's Drive Vignerons
France,"An aroma of pure lychee announces a wine that is attractively balanced. It wears its richness easily; it's ripe and fruity, with a good level of acidity. With a medium-sweet character, it is a great wine for Asian cuisine.",91,40.0,Alsace,Alsace,Gewürztraminer,Domaine Albert Mann
France,"As rich as it is tannic, this is powerful and concentrated. It shows the rich 2009 fruit at its best, full of sweet berries, deliciously ripe. Enjoyable, while it is also serious.",92,24.0,Beaujolais,Morgon,Gamay,Georges Duboeuf
US,"Dark, almost black cherry colored, this is an authoritative wine with concentrated layers of red and black fruits. It's thick through the midpalate, then swings into an interesting, minty, lifted, citrusy finish. Spicy and tart, with real meat on its bones.",90,50.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Merlot,Kestrel
France,"From the family-owned J. Dumangin, this is a full, fruity, ripe wine that's full of sweet apple and lime flavors, with a bright orange-zest texture. It's also more serious than this fruitiness suggests, with dense flavor and concentration that promises to age.",92,53.0,Champagne,Champagne,Champagne Blend,J. Dumangin Fils
Italy,"Very thin and brownish in appearance, this looks and tastes much older than it is. It has resinous notes of caramel, chestnut wood, maple syrup, dried figs and dried flowers. The resin flavors are long lasting, as is the finish.",86,24.0,Tuscany,Colli Etruria Centrale,White Blend,Bindella

US,"This is tough in tannins and somewhat rustic now, in the way of young Monte Bellos. There's not much to recommend opening it anytime soon, especially if you're a fan of the modern style of accessible lusciousness. But it is rich and minerally, with a fine core of black fruit. Monte Bello Estate (not to be confused with Ridge's similarly-named Estate Monte Bello, which costs far less) is a wine that historically ages very well, and 2009 was a pretty good vintage, so you're safe cellaring it for at least 10 years.",92,150.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ridge
France,"Vinified in the soft, opulent style of Chambolle, this is ripe and round. With its dry edge and rich fruit, the structure of the apparent is apparent. The acidity cuts through to give a juicy element. Already delicious to drink, but it's worth aging over 2–3 years.",89,68.0,Burgundy,Chambolle-Musigny,Pinot Noir,Domaine Heresztyn

US,"This small production (200 cases) Pinot Noir is a mix of older and younger estate vines, a selection of lots given 22 months in 60 and 132 gallon French oak casks. It's still tasting quite young, sharp and chewy, with spicy fruit backed up against earthy tannins. Give it plenty of breathing time.",87,38.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,David Hill

US,"A mirror image of the winery's 2005 Merlot, this reverses the proportions, with Cabernet making up 90% of the blend. Straightforward black cherry fruit is accompanied with ashy tannins, not too rough. Though balanced, it's a thin wine, without much depth or texture.",86,20.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,JLC

On the finish, this is tannic, with strong spice notes and a hint of green.",86,18.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Merlot,Domaine Jean Bousquet
US,"So ripe and sweet in raspberry jam, cherry pie and plum sauce flavor, it makes it hard to appreciate the other qualities of this Syrah. It also has lovely, soft tannins and a long, spicy finish. Doesn't leave much to the imagination, but it sure is a tasty wine.",87,46.0,California,Napa Valley,Syrah,Eponymous
US,"Jacaman's basic county-wide Pinot isn't as good as their Anderson Valley or Russian River bottlings, but it's not as expensive. Shows a good grasp of Pinot essentials, with a silky texture framing cherry, cola and spice flavors.",84,20.0,California,Sonoma County,Pinot Noir,J. Jacaman
US,"Kudos to the winery for holding this estate grown wine back for five-plus years. The wine is now softly dry and enormously complex, showing blackberry and cherry liqueur flavors that are beginning to age into drier, earthier notes of dried fruits and minerals. Cofermentation with some Viognier adds the perfect touch of bright, citrusy acidity.",94,38.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Syrah,Vineyard of Pasterick
France,"Spicy wood gives this wine a smooth character. It also adds lift, allowing the rich black fruits to speak out. Acidity is well integrated into the tannins and balanced character of the wine. It's one of seven Bordeaux properties in the Yung family since 1962. Drink from 2016.",88,20.0,Bordeaux,Cadillac Côtes de Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château les Hauts de Palette
Spain,"Smooth berries and plenty of dark licorice carry the seductive bouquet. And seeing that this is Remelluri's signature high-priced red, you should expect the fine berry, plum and chocolate flavors that rest comfortably on the palate. But like many '02s, the wine has a hard mouthfeel and pronounced acidity, so it doesn't quite trigger all the pleasure points that it might in a better vintage.",89,104.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo,"Granja Ntra, Sra. de Remelluri"
US,"With 10% Petite Sirah, which seems to give it a tannic essence of dark fruit intensity, this Zin is enormous in jammy blackberry and cherry fruit, with cola and caramel notes. It's full-bodied and dry and, once again, those tannins are center-stage.",87,36.0,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel,Phipps
Italy,"Spicy and savory, it offers aromas of white and black pepper along with raspberry, dark cherry and hints of bell pepper that carry over to the palate along with aggressive tannins. Drink 2015–2021.",87,19.0,Northeastern Italy,Venezia Giulia,Refosco,Tenuta Luisa
US,"A funny wine, maybe going through an awkward stage. It's pale, light-bodied, silky, acidic and bone dry, with cherry, orange zest, root beer, kid leather and vanilla spice flavors. Resembles a decent Barbaresco at a young age. Seems a bit simple now, but could develop bottle complexity over the next five years.",87,24.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Nebbiolo,Mandolina
France,91-93 Barrel sample. Rich but beautifully elegant that guards great freshness on top of the Merlot richness. The tannins are structured but well integrated. There is a high spice character to finish.,92,24.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Tronquoy-Lalande

Australia,"Deliciously fruity, this full-bodied Shiraz offers a big mouthful of flavor for the price, ranging from plums to mixed berries.

France,"A wine with great color, attractive smoky and red fruit flavors and a touch of tannin. It has a good structure as well, reflecting wood aging as well as fine fruit. Drink from 2016.",89,40.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,Pinot Noir,Domaine Matthias et Emile Roblin
US,"Bengay, tomato and rhubarb waft from the glass before aromas of holiday spice emerge. This wine has dusty, underripe tannins and a medium body. A good try from an emerging growing region, but lack of ripeness still seems to be a factor, leading to rhubarb flavors.",82,30.0,Colorado,Grand Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Verso
Italy,"From the beautiful Salento region  comes this warm-climate, slightly aged blend of Chardonnay and Malvasia Bianca. The color is rich and saturated and so are the aromas of mature apricot, passion fruit and almond. It's a big, chewy wine with loads of intensity.",85,24.0,Southern Italy,Salento,White Blend,Conti Zecca
US,"Pure Syrah, the value offering from McCrea Cellars, with fruit sourced from Ciel du Cheval, Boushey and the up-and-coming Elephant Mountain and Sugarloaf vineyards.

The wine is smooth and supple, beautifully integrated and showing some pleasing toast and chocolate notes.",89,25.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Syrah,McCrea

US,"A very ripe tropical-fruit nose is complemented beautifully by an intense smoky-toasty element. Pineapple, mango and caramel flavors stand out on the full palate: The smoky note resurfaces later, riding out the persistent finish. This is a sleek, stylish, but very solidly built Chardonnay. It pushes all the right sensory buttons, with big body and great lines, like a '56 Buick.",91,58.0,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay,Jarvis
US,"Dry and meaty, with tannic flavors of grilled beef, blackberries, smoky oak, pepper and other spices. Feels dense, solid and vital, a wine that could develop bottle complexity through 2013. It's a blend of Syrah, Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon.",90,28.0,California,Paso Robles,Red Blend,D'Anbino

US,"Made in a super Tuscan style, this blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is lush and lovely. Lightly floral aromatics introduce notes of berry, plum and a whiff of leather.

US,"The acids in white wines of the 2008 vintage are superb; and the beautiful match of acids and sugars in many Washington Rieslings is nicely displayed here. The aromas are ripe and rich with a nice mix of floral, apple, stone fruit and light tropical fruit. Flavors evolve with pleasingly sweet hints of honey and tea; this feels like a wine that could age beautifully.",91,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling,Trust

Spain,"Ripe, dense and powerful, with on onslaught of raisin, spice, pepper and leather on the nose.

Italy,"Pio Cesare was founded in 1881 and has consistently represented the best of Piedmont winemaking tradition over its many years in existence.

France,"The blend is 60% Roussanne, 40% Marsanne, apparently barrel-fermented and aged, as the toast, smoke and coffee elements dominate the nose and palate.

Drink now.",86,13.0,Rhône Valley,Costières de Nîmes,White Blend,Château Grande Cassagne

Argentina,"A rich and creamy sort of Malbec that pours on the weight, extract and oaky, coconutty character. The palate is syrupy, with huge flavors of roasted berry, molasses and sweet spices. Arguably on the baked and heavy side, but definitely a rich, huge wine with just enough core acidity to keep it balanced.",89,30.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Siesta
US,"This 100% Cabernet tastes way too oaky. Vanilla cream and caramel dominate the blackberries and black currants, giving it a woody sweetness. The question is, will it age out? The classic answer is that a wine that tastes unbalanced when young most likely always will.",84,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Quivet Cellars

Argentina,"Melon, peach and dusty aromas give the wine a solid but flat bouquet. With soft edges and modest citric acid, it's a little dull and disjointed as it stresses melon and apple flavors. As Argentine SBs go, this is expensive for what it offers.",84,20.0,Other,Neuquén,Sauvignon Blanc,Familia Schroeder

US,"A spicy but subtle nose of cigar spice and red berry lead into a spirited character of more spice and medium body on the palate.

France,"Gironville is in the southern Haut-Médoc, close to Margaux, and is capable of producing the same style of wine—open and not overly tannic.

No doubt for long-term aging.",98,411.0,Burgundy,Bienvenues Bâtard-Montrachet,Chardonnay,Domaine Leflaive
Argentina,"Mint and rubber band scents open the bouquet, and then black fruit and marmalade aromas take over. This Bonarda is riper, softer and more cuddly than most, with ultraripe black-fruit flavors and soft tannins that make it borderline sappy. Plump, easygoing and loaded with fruit. Drink now to get the soft, giving side of this grape.",89,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Bonarda,Dante Robino
US,"This has a very deep, dark color that goes almost to the rim. It smells like blackberries and black pepper, tastes exotic and almost full-bodied but stays quite dry.

US,"Though it seems quite light on first impression, that is a bit deceptive. The biodynamic grapes show a muted earthiness, while over time the cranberry and raspberry flavors gain focus and concentration in the mouth. A graceful, nicely proportioned wine, with some stem and grip to the tannins.",91,40.0,Oregon,McMinnville,Pinot Noir,Kelley Fox

US,"Two-thirds Cabernet and one-third Syrah, this is a creative blend of Cayuse grapes, with the pungent, herbal, earthy character that the En Cerise vineyard delivers in spades.

Bright acidity appears on the finish.",90,19.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Red Blend,Tua Rita
Spain,"Given how cool and difficult the 2008 vintage was, this is impressive. Bold, oaky aromas of coconut, cola and mocha come with a blackberry backing.

US,"This is a dark, sappy, saturated wine, and the power and grip of the fruit belies its claim of 12.9% alcohol.

Thoroughly delicious and captivating.",89,30.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Malbec,Tagaris

Spain,"Dark and spicy, with rubber and baked-fruit aromas giving way to herbs, clove and other alluring spice scents.

Good now and for the next several years.",90,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Red Blend,Palacios Remondo
US,"Coniglio specializes in appellation-specific bottlings from Napa Valley. With this Cab, they have captured the essence of Diamond Mountain. It's a sturdy, tannic, ageworthy wine, with the density of flavors and complex structure that low-yielding mountain grapes give. Rich and appealing, it should develop over the next decade.",94,60.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon,Coniglio
Argentina,"Chunky and generic smelling, with a nutty, oily palate that isn't purely focused or clean. The palate has some bitterness and excess weight along with fading lychee and melon flavors.

Italy,"An 85-15 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this shows incredible intensity and gorgeous aromas of cherry, blackberry, oak-driven spice, chocolate and coffee.

Argentina,"Bold and pruney, with herbal, soft, ultraripe aromas in front of a jumpy yet partially stewed palate. This blend of Malbec with Bonarda and Syrah is your typical huge, tannic bruiser with big extract, huge tannins and just enough acidity to keep it pumping. Pretty good and perfectly drinkable, but a little over the edge.",87,40.0,Other,Famatina Valley,Red Blend,Valle de la Puerta
US,"This blend is concentrated and meaty. It perfectly captures and combines the raspberry intensity of the Grenache, the brambleberry fruit of the Mourvèdre and the peppery smoke and spice of the Syrah. Somehow winemaker James Mantone coaxes something akin to French garrigue out of the grapes as well, making this one of a handful of Washington Rhônes that really capture those elusive French herbal highlights.",93,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend,Syncline

It exits smoothly with a finishing lick of caramel.",91,42.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Pinot Noir,Owen Roe
US,"At four-plus years, this is a harsh wine, tough in tannins and over-oaked. You'll find blackberry, cherry, currant and herb flavors and a dry, hard finish. Okay for everyday fare, but pricey for what you get.",84,45.0,California,Alexander Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Murphy-Goode

US,"Named for winemaker Virginie Bourgue, this entirely stainless-fermented Sauvignon Blanc has a grassy, spicy edge reminiscent of Loire Valley whites.

US,"Arger-Martucci hits bigtime with this Cabernet Franc-based Bordeaux-style blend. It marches in a different direction from the soft cult style, showing brisk acidity, hard tannins and relatively moderate alcohol. Yet there's nothing light about the complex blackberry, cherry and currant flavors. Wonderful to drink now, and it will reward aging over the next 5–6 years.",94,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Arger-Martucci
US,"Aromas of blood, nori and worn leather compose the nose, with a touch of charred bread that adds a subtle bitterness. Light to medium bodied, the palate feels pliant at the start, but the acids spike and tower over the tannins as the wine spreads across the palate. A flavor of tart raspberry marks the finish.",83,20.0,Virginia,Monticello,Merlot-Petite Verdot,Autumn Hill

US,"It's important to not drink this Merlot right out of the bottle, because it's pretty tannic, and thus it's hard to appreciate the wine's beautiful fruit. Give it some time in a decanter to reveal the complex flavors of blackberry, cherry jam, grilled prosciutto, cassis, red licorice, cola and spice. It's unclear if this will age for a long time, but it can certainly be enjoyed over the next five years.",91,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Merlot,Shafer

France,"Densely textured, this pure Tannat lives up to the name Plénitude (generous or full). It is characterized by dark plum and licorice flavor, very tannic with ripe fruit to match.

There's nothing challenging about this red; just pour it with pizza or burgers and enjoy.",86,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Bonarda,Alma de los Andes

US,"This new, limited release red blend is what winery owners Myles Anderson and Gordy Venneri called their version of a super Tuscan. It's half old-vine Cabernet Sauvignon from the Sagemoor vineyard, and half Sangiovese.

Just 240 cases were made and the wine is sold exclusively at the winery.",92,36.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend,Walla Walla Vintners
Australia,"Unusual for Oz, in that the primary variety in the blend is Cabernet Franc (74%), with lesser amounts of Merlot (15%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (11%).

Spain,"Choppy, stalky red-berry aromas shows a modest green note and a reedy quality. Although raw in feel, this offers a solid mix of plum and stalky berry flavors.

Argentina,Roasted berry aromas are stalky at first but come around. This feels round but only marginally structured. Creamy ripe generic flavors of berry and cherry finish solid with some heat.,86,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tomero
Italy,"An excellent example of the potential and appeal of Pinot Bianco, an increasingly popular variety from Northern Italy. The bouquet is perfumed and expressive but the wine really excels in the mouth thanks to its density and butter-like silkiness.",90,20.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,Pinot Bianco,Elena Walch
US,"Represents a very nice value in a refreshing, balanced Chardonnay. The wine, which was aged in lots of new American oak and stirred on the lees, is rich and creamy, with citrus, mineral and yeasty flavors that are brightened by crisp acidity.",87,9.0,California,California,Chardonnay,Bogle
France,"Soft, almond and ripe fruit flavored wine. It is rounded, missing the real tang of a good Crémant but still a fruity, fresh and flowery apéritif wine.",85,17.0,Alsace,Crémant d'Alsace,Sparkling Blend,Willm
Spain,"Smells sort of gummy and candied, with aromas of red licorice stick, raisin and raspberry jam. The palate is sizable but comes with racy acidity, thus the flavors veer toward red fruits with an herbal accent. Burns a little on the finish due to sharp acids.",85,20.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Valpiedra
France,"A lighter, earthy style of Cahors, with attractive food-friendly red berry fruits and a core of tannins. There is a mineral character here, tightly woven over the fruit.",86,24.0,Southwest France,Cahors,Malbec,Château Armandière
US,"Foley's second wine, this is partly from their Santa Rita Hills estate and partly from the new Solomon Hills vineyard, in Santa Maria. It's a fine, dry Pinot, with bitter cherry, unsweetened cocoa, cola and subtle herb and spice flavors.",85,22.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Pinot Noir,Lincourt
France,"A complex, rich and ripe wine. It shows both a tannic edge and full red fruit flavors. With acidity cutting through, this is finely balanced, a delicious and serious wine that would benefit from a few more months in bottle.",92,22.0,Provence,Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence,Rosé,Château Vignelaure
US,"A very good wine, rich and softly drinkable now, with voluptuous tannins. It's extraordinarily ripe in blackberries, black cherries, anise, chocolate, spices and cedar. Doesn't seem all that much better than the winery's regular '06 Cab, at less than half the price, but it's quite opulent and will develop for a decade.",94,105.0,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon,Peju
France,"Not many sparklers have anise aromas to match white stone fruits, but this 100% Chenin Blanc has just that, and more. Crisp and lively with citrus fruits flavors, especially lemon and lime, the wine has firm mineral and some stemmy notes to add character.  Goes to show you can still find good French sparklers for bargain prices.",88,12.0,Loire Valley,Vouvray,Chenin Blanc,Domaine de Vaugondy
US,"So high in acidity that it creates a tingly burn on the palate, this dry wine is bright and forward in lemon and lime flavors, and a tangy minerality. Finishes fine and clean.",87,25.0,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay,Ortman Family
Argentina,"Smoke and burnt rubber are prominent aromas. This PV feels grabby and pushy, with hard tannins. Creamy candied-berry flavors are sweet and chocolaty, while this tastes of oak, caramel and vanilla on the finish.",87,35.0,Mendoza Province,La Consulta,Petit Verdot,Altocedro
Spain,"This is solid stuff for the price, with berry and pencil eraser aromas. It feels more soft than hard, with a jammy mouthfeel and grabby tannins in front of berry and plum flavors that turn medicinal.",85,5.0,Levante,Utiel-Requena,Tempranillo,Viña Decana
France,"A wine initially dominated by wood, but opens to show ripe, black fruits, flavors of herbs and firm, dry tannins. From an 88-acre vineyard in the west of Listrac, this is a finely structured wine, which will certainly age well. Imported by Heidelberg Distribution.",88,13.0,Bordeaux,Listrac-Médoc,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Fonréaud
France,"Powerful, intense and packed with rich green fruits, this is the top wine from Thierry Redde. There's an attractive smoky character to the ripe fruit, a bloom of summer herbs and some good lively apple flavors. Drink now, or keep for another year.",90,24.0,Loire Valley,Pouilly-Fumé,Sauvignon Blanc,Michel Redde et Fils
Argentina,"Toasty oak aromas hint at something serious, but in the mouth it's a dud. Banana and resin flavors are all you get, and the mouthfeel is flat as a board. Overoaked and dull.",81,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Chardonnay,Viña Cobos
Italy,"This is a beautiful Pinot Grigio on all fronts: The aromas are pristine but intense and the mouthfeel is sophisticated and layered. Fresh fruit tones of apricot, peach, honey and white almond are packed tight and last long on the palate.",90,26.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,Pinot Grigio,St. Pauls
US,"Much like the winery's pleasing Pinot Gris, this Dijon clone Chard is made in a clean, lightly herbal style. Roughly half was barrel fermented and half in stainless, all resting sur lie for twelve months. Along with the crisp apple flavors and sweet grass are hints of wet stone and a gentle impression of bourbon barrel.",86,22.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,Left Coast Cellars
US,"This is 100% varietal, and sports interesting aromas of Provençal herbs. Peppery cranberry fruit is spicy and tart, fading through the midpalate into a lean, but lingering finish.",89,35.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Grenache,Folin Cellars
US,"Superfruity and jammy, with massive raspberry, cherry, blackberry and dark chocolate flavors, accented with black pepper. The texture is soft and voluptuous. This Syrah is a bit direct now, with its primary fruit and oak overlay, and it's a little hot, with an official alcohol reading of 15.5%.",87,52.0,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Syrah,Harrison Clarke
France,"Tight, taut steely in character, this tastes of its great chalk terroir. It has delicious layered crispness, green and fresh red apples, finished with a powerful citrus element. Without doubt, a wine for aging.",91,35.0,Burgundy,Chablis,Chardonnay,Simonnet-Febvre
US,"The nose here shows clean pine and citrus notes, with accents of herb and tropical fruit. Straightforward apple, pear and nut flavors show on the palate. In some ways, including the nutty finish, the wine is good—in other ways, it's just there.",86,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay,Plumpjack
Italy,"This is a very interesting wine that shows a unique bouquet of wild berry, dried rosemary and black olive aromas. There is elegance and balance here, with a tight, velvety finish.",90,28.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Carignano del Sulcis,Carignano,Cantina Santadi
US,"From estate-grown Merlot (78%), Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is shy on the nose and full bodied in flavor, offering ripe, fleshy blackberry, tar and espresso.",88,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Madrigal
US,"The aromas mingle black cherry and dark chocolate with mint, plus modest oak. In the mouth, it really comes alive with deeply satisfying flavors and soft velvety tannins.",89,22.0,California,Sonoma County,Merlot,Clos du Bois
US,"This almost pure Cab (just 2% Malbec) is almost midnight black in color. Fragrant with strong barrel scents of toast and char; the fruit has a spicy, citrusy lift to it that keeps the thick tannins from weighing it down. The big tannins and powerful, smoky notes do not overpower the rather delicate fruit; it all works together in a harmonious balance.",89,19.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Three Rivers
Argentina,"Quite green and on the verge of deserving the dreaded weedy designation, this Cab fails to show much ripe fruit character even if the mouthfeel is decent. It's like a wet-vintage cru bourgeois Bordeaux.",80,10.0,Other,Cafayate,Cabernet Sauvignon,Don Rodolfo
US,"A simple wine. The underlying Zin is rather thin and jammy, while a clumsy overlay of oak adds unnatural vanilla and woodsap flavors.",82,16.0,California,California,Zinfandel,Bin 36
France,"The chateau owes its name to the 18th-century Joseph Laffitte who created the estate. The wine ,which comes from the heart of Saint-Estèphe, is ripe with spice. With generous tannins and equally generous fruit, it is dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon that gives it the structure as well as the juicy fruitiness. Drink this fine wine from 2021.",92,45.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Estèphe,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Laffitte Carcasset
US,"Black cherry fruits sink even deeper into blackberry jam on this nose, which is leveled by vanilla and black licorice. It's chunky and sticky once sipped, with blueberry juice and chocolate-chip elements that are cut with anise-like herbs. Espresso shows on the finish, which is slightly sour and bitter.",87,45.0,California,Paso Robles,Merlot,HammerSky
US,"A little unbalanced, with a soft, melted structure housing slightly sweet, candied cherry flavors, along with olives and sage. Finishes with some sharpness. Drink now.",84,22.0,California,Paso Robles,Syrah,Minassian-Young
US,"This is soft and lightly chocolaty, with very thin fruit flavors suggesting cranberry, red apple and watery cassis.",83,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot,Hogue
Italy,"A burnt touch of roasted walnut appears at first, but it is quickly replaced with tones of cherry and dried raspberry. This Sangiovese (blended with 10% Merlot) shows bitter fruit on the finish, which helps it pair with meat or cheese dishes.",85,17.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,Sangiovese,Fattoria la Castellina
US,"There was significant variation among three different bottles opened. At best this is a tannic, somewhat reductive wine with light fruit that is overwhelmed by new American oak. At worst it tastes mostly of charred wood, bitter smoke, tar and rubber.",83,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah,Hogue
US,"A modern style coastal Chardonnay, brimming with acidity and starring major league pineapple, tangerine, Asian pear, buttered toast and honey vanilla flavors. Very rich and flamboyant. Calls for a rich shellfish dish in a cream sauce.",91,38.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay,Expression 38
Italy,"Thick, dark concentration sets the tone, but elegance and harmony are achieved thanks to delicate mineral and balsam notes that add buoyancy and personality. This is a wine that speaks volumes about its Tuscan territory and you can almost taste that sun-drenched, chalky minerality sucked up through the vines' roots.",92,60.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Sangiovese,Poggio Scalette
US,"This is a barrel selection from vines approaching 20 years of age. It's still quite tight, yet showing deeper riper fruit flavors than the Lylee. A judicious mix of cranberry, raspberry and black cherry, streaked with cola, contributes length, polish and texture to the finish. Drink 2018 through 2025.",91,40.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Brigadoon
US,"This is a restaurant-style Pinot Noir, classy and restrained. It shows classic raspberry, cherry, cola, pomegranate and spice flavors, with brisk Russian River acidity and a silky mouthfeel. Doesn't seem like an ager, but it's a lovely wine now and for the next few years.",92,33.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Joseph Jewell
Argentina,"Yellow in color, blowsy on the nose, and chunky to the max in the mouth. This wine is big, forced and heavy, with orange, banana and melon flavors. Finishes soft and with no discernible oak or elegance.",83,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Chardonnay,Alpamanta
US,"Yummy, with ripe, plush berries running rampant across the tongue. The juicy acids and underlying minerality add lift and life, but the fruit, rolling from cranberry to boysenberry to blackberry, just won't let go. The structure suggests ageability for another decade of more.",91,30.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Pinot Noir,Kudos
US,"An entirely satsifying Pinot Noir that meets all the variety's basic requirements. It's dry, crisp and silky in texture, with oak-nuanced flavors of raspberries, cinnamon and mocha. Drink now in its flamboyant youth.",92,40.0,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,Kent Rasmussen
US,"The fruit is soft and faded in this wine, which is otherwise soft-medium in body,. It's made by a longstanding producer of Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon.",85,20.0,California,Livermore Valley,Grenache,Concannon
France,"A very smoky nose is reminsicent of mocha. This oaky spice is also very evident on the light, red-fruited body. There is a bitter edge to the soft tannins but also a warm finish.",87,50.0,Alsace,Alsace,Pinot Noir,Joseph Cattin
Australia,"A luscious Merlot-based blend, this is full-bodied, soft and rounded. Flavors build upon a base of coffee and black cherry or plum, then add hints of musk and cinnamon. Long and silky-textured on the finish; best enjoyed over the next five or six years.",92,20.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,Red Blend,Dutschke
Italy,"This 60-40 super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese and Merlot offers a smooth and clean quality of berry fruit, cassis and raspberry. You'll also recognize spice, leather, tobacco and soft chocolate fudge on the close.",90,80.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Red Blend,Fattoria di Grignano
France,"A blend of 90% Grenache and 10% Syrah, all from vines averaging 80 years of age, this is a stupendously concentrated wine that still possesses nuance and complexity. Exotic spices—notably lavender and clove—scent the bouquet, while the huge palate boasts layers of plum fruit and thick, velvety tannins. Drinkable now, but probably at its best after 2012.",92,40.0,Rhône Valley,Gigondas,Rhône-style Red Blend,Château de Saint-Cosme
Spain,"Waxy peach and apple aromas come with a leesy cookie-like component. This is 50% each Sauvignon Blanc and Garnacha Blanca, and it feels both plump and watery. Flavors of quince and apple are diluted and distant, while the finish is mild.",84,12.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,White Blend,Navardia
US,"Dry, tannic and severe, this Merlot has modest blackberry and cherry flavors. It's tough to appreciate right out of the bottle, and won't age, so give it an hour or two in a decanter.",85,20.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Merlot,Rancho Sisquoc
France,"Like many 2005s from the northern Rhone, Colombo's Les Ruchets needs time. The tannins dominate the mouth right now, but the black olive and peppered-meat nuances win out in the end, adding depth to tarry, leathery notes and plummy fruit. Try after 2015.",91,88.0,Rhône Valley,Cornas,Syrah,Jean-Luc Colombo
Italy,"Le Salette's wines always show a beautiful balance between bright fruit integrity and spicy, oak-related renderings. This vintage is no exception. You'll recognize aromas of black cherry, cola, nutmeg and spicy ginger on the close.",92,67.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Le Salette
US,"This has 5% Viognier blended in as an experiment; the winemaker says he probably won't do it again. Spicy and citrusy, young and light, this elegant style of Syrah tastes like wild raspberries and barely hints at pepper, citrus rind and grapefruit. There is some detectable volatility in the finish.",87,23.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Syrah,Edmonds Winery
Australia,"Two Hands' top-of-the-line Shiraz is a selection of the best barrels, boasting luscious vanilla and cedar from the oak, but also layers of raspberry and blackberry fruit. It's creamy, lush and vanilla-laden but elegant at the same time, with a long, slightly tart finish. Delicious now, but should age well through 2015.",93,150.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,Shiraz,Two Hands
Italy,"This is one of those hammer-over-your-head reds that takes aromatic intensity to the stratosphere. Inky black in color with cracked white pepper, exotic spice, resin, crushed stone, cedar, cherry fruit marmalade; there are no subtle nuances here, only bold statements. Imported by Palm Bay Imports.",87,9.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,Shiraz,MandraRossa
US,"Let this one breathe for an hour or two. At first it tastes a bit tired, but oxygen perks it up and restores vivacity to the fruit. Ultimately, it's a very softly structured, very dry wine, with complex cherry, coffee, herb, cola and tea flavors. Drink now.",87,35.0,California,Alexander Valley,Merlot,Medlock Ames
US,"Made from the old Clone 1, which gives classic grass and citrus flavors, and the Musqué clone, which contributes brighter gooseberry notes. Absolutely dry, and boosted by mouthwateringly zesty acidity, it also has low alcohol. This is one of the purest expressions of unoaked, non-malolactic Sauvignon Blanc in California.",91,16.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Mauritson
Italy,"This blend of Nero d'Avola, Merlot and Syrah opens with aromas of  black-skinned berry and baking spice while the straightforward palate offers black cherry and white pepper alongside chewy tannins. It's made to be consumed young so enjoy soon.",87,11.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Terre Siciliane,Red Blend,Fondo Antico
Italy,"A lovely, lush wine with bold, direct aromas of ripe cherry, cured meat, blackberry preserves and exotic spice. It presents a clean and fresh mouthfeel, with solid structure on the long finish.",93,25.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese Grosso,Bonacchi
Italy,"Orchard fruit, citrus and almond aromas follow through to the palate. Fresh acidity enlivens the yellow apple and nectarine flavors while a hint of Mediterranean herb closes the finish.",89,24.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Terre Siciliane,Grillo,Paolo Calì
France,"Soft, rather unfocused wine, its fruit slow to show. There are flavors of apple juice, a tight steely edge, but the wine finishes simply.",86,26.0,Burgundy,Chablis,Chardonnay,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils
US,"Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot dominate the blend, with other varieties not identified by the winery. The wine is sweet and not quite ripe.",82,14.0,California,California,Red Blend,Echelon
US,"A deeply impressive Bordeaux blend. It comes from this small, but prestigious, appellation, which is a bridge between Sonoma County and Napa Valley. Marked by dryness and a superb tannic structure, it has deep flavors of blackberries, black currants, violets, herbs and cedar. Needs time. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar.",94,39.0,California,Knights Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ehret
US,"With a dark, old gold color and rich aromas of apricot honey, this wine promises to reward with opulence. But it doesn't live up to the advance billing. It's extraordinarily sweet, yet the citrus and apricot fruit is curiously thin and fleeting.",85,30.0,California,Sonoma County,Sémillon,Ferrari-Carano
Italy,Caprili brings us a beautifully elegant and shapely Brunello that is enhanced by plump cherry and wild berry nuances. Subdued tones of vanilla and spice add a nice touch of zest on the long finish.,92,55.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese Grosso,Caprili
Italy,"There's a sharp, brambly note here of forest green and sour cherry that eventually transforms into spice and blackberry as the wine spends more time in the glass. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky.",85,28.0,Tuscany,Rosso di Montalcino,Sangiovese Grosso,Le Potazzine
US,"A great Weir from Williams Selyem, showing a complex balance on the warm-cool-climate spectrum. It's very ripe in blackberries and cherries, but crisp in acidity, firm in tannins, and totally dry. Balanced and delicious but young, this wine will benefit from six years in a proper cellar.",93,56.0,California,Yorkville Highlands,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
France,"Powerful and intense without going over the top, this is a fine example of white Hermitage. The golden straw color gives a first indication of its richness, followed by scents of honey, even a hint of butterscotch. It's unctuous in the mouth, boasting flavors of grilled nuts and stone fruits, and finishing with just a touch of warmth.",92,50.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,Rhône-style White Blend,Delas Frères
Italy,"This happy blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet and Merlot delivers delicate blueberry nuances and warm toast. It's a wine that flows over the palate, leaving it clean and refreshed.",90,20.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Red Blend,Tenuta San Vito
US,"A very rich, extracted and oaky style of Cabernet. You could almost call it a fruit bomb. Blasts in the mouth with an explosion of cherries, blackberries, plums, currants and carob. Lacks finesse. Could develop, but it's a risk.",86,110.0,California,St. Helena,Cabernet Sauvignon,B Cellars
US,"This basic Cab shows blackberry, currant and oak flavors wrapped into firm tannins. It's a sound, good wine, with a briary, rustic edge. Drink now.",84,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hess
US,"In this gold-colored wine, green-apple skin and nutmeg-ginger spice wrap around a full-bodied build, with a preponderance of ripe peach within its makeup too. Decadent, and nutty from the oak, it brings a fulsomeness of crème brûlée to the finish.",88,29.0,California,Alexander Valley,Chardonnay,Eco Terreno
US,"This wine has some funky scents of soy and silage, with simple, thin fruit. It falls off quickly; there's no weight to it and the oak flavors have nothing to lean against.",86,75.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Archery Summit
US,"Almost jet black, this single-vineyard reserve sports marvelously complex aromas of smoked meat and dark fruits. Those perfectly ripened and layered berry, black cherry and cassis flavors are wrapped in slightly smoky, super-smooth tannins.",94,65.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Syrah,Va Piano
US,"Flawed. Smells and tastes dirty and funky, with medicinal cherry flavors.",82,35.0,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,McKenzie-Mueller
Argentina,"Tight, concentrated and deep, with rubbery aromas of black fruit and earth. The palate is rich and layered, with lemony oak setting up herbal, powerful berry fruit flavors that come with hints of tea and briar. Zesty as well as rich, and well balanced. Nicely done for Salta Syrah.",89,17.0,Other,Cafayate,Syrah,Michel Torino
US,"Citrus oil, cherries, clean earth and sweet coffee notes configure this well-crafted Syrah from McKinley Springs vineyard grapes. More flavors emerge with time—black olive and pepper, dried herbs and sandalwood. Bright and assertive, with precisely defined tannins.",91,20.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Syrah,Robert Ramsay
US,Elegant nose of sandalwood and cedar. Black cherries come on strong and carry through to the finish. A very smooth and polished wine; finishes on an expansive note with fine tannins.,89,30.0,New York,"The Hamptons, Long Island",Merlot,Wölffer
US,"Something went south on this Cabernet-Syrah blend, and the problem probably was the Cab, because the winery's regular Syrah is really good. This wine is sharp and vinegary, with sweet and sour cherry flavors.",81,44.0,California,Paso Robles,Red Blend,La Capilla
US,"Made in a lighter style, this wine is nonetheless rich and complex in flavor, proving that Pinot Noir doesn't have to be heavy to be really good. It's dry and spicy, with raspberry, cherry, red licorice and Dr. Pepper flavors. Drink now.",90,40.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Paradise Ridge
Argentina,"This is a lively, slightly jagged wine with full ripeness and lots of berry, spice and zip. The palate hits hard with cherry, raspberry and pepper flavors, and there's a bit of rasp and burn to the finish. Should get a little softer with more bottle age.",89,50.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Merlot-Malbec,Trapiche
US,"Lovely and creamy, with thick, juicy flavors of citrus peel, honey, lemon and white peach fruits. Graham cracker and oatmeal flavors coat the finish; overall a very fleshy mouthful of wine. Just 200 cases produced.",90,26.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Roussanne,DeLille
US,"This showcases lovely, sappy cherry and raspberry flavors that are grounded and given greater interest by a rich, mulchy earthiness and also a slight funkiness—like wild mushrooms pan-sautéed in bacon fat. Alluring and complex, it's a Pinot Noir that will gain traction over the next six years.",93,45.0,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,Saintsbury
France,"There is an excellent depth of flavor in this ripe and fruity wine. It is more about rich fruits than it is about structure, giving a full and rounded character to the plum-jelly, spice and mint flavors. Ready to drink in a year.",90,16.0,Southwest France,Pécharmant,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château de Corbiac
Italy,"Made from organically farmed fruit and aged for eight months in oak barrels, this dark, opulent blend is comprised of Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, plus a tiny amount of Petit Verdot. Ripe fruit, blackberry jam and cured meat flavors are enhanced by thickly textured tannins.",88,24.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Red Blend,Castello di Vicarello
US,"Very tart, almost sour, this high-acid wine just might be a good match for fresh oysters, but on its own it is slightly bitter and barely ripe.",84,16.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris,Tyee Wine Cellars
Australia,"A great price for a solid example of Eden Valley Riesling. Lime sherbet and talcum powder define the aromas, and green apple joins in on the palate. It's crisp, dry and nicely textured, with a hint of iodine on the finish.",89,14.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,Riesling,Thorn Clarke
US,"Too sweet by far, with sugary flavors of berry-cherry pie filling. The sweeteness is compounded by high alcohol and glycerines.",82,23.0,California,Santa Clara Valley,Zinfandel,Martin Ranch

US,"The blended Pinot is lighter in body and lower in alcohol than the special bottlings, but still features a wonderful sense of balance and plenty of complexity. Chocolate, cinnamon and black cherry scents mark the nose, while the flavors add briary, herbal hints. Well-structured, with some slightly dusty tannins on the finish. Drink now–2015.",89,42.0,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,Etude
US,"Made in a more extracted, fuller style, this is overwhelmingly earthy and intensely aromatic. Its time in oak has not quite shaken off entirely, and its fruit expression veers on the darker side, with notes of black cherries and blueberries standing out the most. An herbal aura lingers around.",88,42.0,California,Mendocino,Pinot Noir,Phillips Hill
US,"As lush and delicious as Napa Merlot gets, this is stunningly with its flavor of milk-chocolate-coated blackberries. The alcohol gives it an anisette liqueur burn, and oak aging contributes rich toast and wood spice notes. For all the upfront generosity, firm tannins and acids keep it balanced.",94,46.0,California,Napa Valley,Merlot,Darioush
US,"This is a spicy, softly lush offering of Cabernet sourced from a tiny part of the Larkmead Vineyard in northern Napa Valley. Black and red currant play off one another well, before revealing subtle layers of dried herb and tobacco leaf, the finish as cushy as the opening and midpalate of the wine.",91,90.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Covenant
Italy,"This is a spicy and exotic-tasting red wine from Central Italy with aromas of nutmeg, clove, rose petal and dark forest fruit.

Australia,"You might not know it from this wine's rather austere exterior, but this is actually from a warm site within the cool Yarra Valley. It's a restrained, slightly herbal blend of 62% Cabernet, 27% Merlot and 11% Petit Verdot that finishes with a tough mouthful of tannin. Hold it for another 3–4 years and hope that the fruit holds up.",89,30.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Giant Steps

US,"The nose on this Ethan Lindquist-made wine from the cool-climate vineyard his parents planted shows a fabulous but not overripe cornucopia of espresso, tobacco leaf, oregano and lava rocks. The flavors are quite savory, with dried blueberries, teriyaki, beef jerky, roasted meat, lavender, rosemary and a citrus-like acidity framing the edges.",93,74.0,California,Edna Valley,Syrah,No Limit
US,"Here's a complex, layered wine that impresses for sheer power. It floods the mouth with ripe flavors of black currants, blackberries, black cherries, dark chocolate, anise and cedar that finish deep and long. Delicious and dry, but quite closed now in tannins, and needs time. Best after 2009, at least.",92,85.0,California,Stags Leap District,Cabernet Sauvignon,Silverado
Australia,"This is a plump, fruit-driven Chardonnay crafted by Yering Station for the U.S. market. Well priced, its clean pear, stone fruit and melon flavors compare favorably with California Chardonnays at higher price points. Imported by Epic Wines.",87,14.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,Chardonnay,Yering Station
Italy,"This boasts thick, sun-drenched notes of mature fruit, intense spice and moist earth. The wine's nose is slightly stewy in essence and has some medicinal qualities on the finish. Drink it with pasta and ground beef ragù.",89,36.0,Tuscany,Sant'Antimo,Merlot,Castello Banfi
Italy,Citrus and aromas of freshly cut grass appear on the nose of this easygoing Pinot Grigio (made from organically-grown grapes). This is a simple and unpretentious wine that would wash down well with mini-pizza appetizers and fried mozzarella sticks.,85,13.0,Northeastern Italy,Delle Venezie,Pinot Grigio,Eugenio Collavini
US,"Tastes a bit stewed, with raisiny, pruny flavors, but on the plus side, it's dry and silky and possesses Pinot Noir's personality.",84,14.0,California,California,Pinot Noir,Five Rivers
France,"With crisp black berry fruits, this is pure juice in a glass. It has fresh acidity, a light layer of tannin and a sweet underlay to the attractive fruitiness.",87,24.0,Beaujolais,Juliénas,Gamay,Georges Duboeuf
US,"While brisk and lean in style, there's a core of vanilla-scented morello cherries and ripe brambly wood. Tannins are so wispy they're barely detectable, but carry through to a soft finish marked by notes of autumn leaves and a gentle spray of raspberries.",85,15.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Merlot,Knapp
Italy,"It took a few minutes to wake the Principessa up; but when she did, there were plenty of bright summer fruit aromas, which seemed to come rushing out as if to make up for lost time. It settled into a pleasant, rich, if not very precise wine with a short to medium finish that will work well with food.",86,14.0,Piedmont,Gavi,Cortese,Principessa Gavia
US,"There's too much oak on this wine, and the underlying fruit isn't strong enough to support it. The result tastes like toothpicks, with modest flavors beneath of tangerines and pears.",83,18.0,California,Carneros,Chardonnay,Kinter Collins
US,"Spicy, meaty flavors like black pepper and beef broth blend with substantial fruit flavors in this medium-bodied, dry and rather sophisticated wine. It's almost a meal in itself, and well-balanced.",89,14.0,California,Lodi,Red Blend,Ghostrider
Argentina,"Smells like corn and a burning hay field, and the palate has little to no fruit left. The mouthfeel is wet and grabby, while the finish is bready then turns bitter. On its last legs; wait for 2010.",81,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Torrontés,Bodega Vistandes
US,"Fresh and fruity with dominating notes of green apple, young white peach, chamomile and sweet grass. Lime citrus appears in the mouth and on the finish, livening up the moderate weight and medium-length finish.",84,11.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay,Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards

France,"Like the hyperexpensive Cuvée à Tempo, Pegau's 2015 Cuvée Reservée has a slightly bitter edge to the finish. Otherwise, it shows subtle pineapple, anise and white gumdrop notes and medium body.",85,63.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,Rhône-style White Blend,Domaine du Pegau
Italy,"Underbrush, ripe plum, tilled earth and dark spice aromas come together in this. The soft, enveloping palate offers juicy black cherry, blackberry extract and licorice flavors, framed by round, pliant tannins. Enjoy through 2019.",88,16.0,Southern Italy,Campania,Aglianico,Villa Matilde
US,"When first opened, despite significant bottle age, it's a bit stubborn, tannic, hard, and showing some heat, iron, black olive, and earth. But with aggressive decanting (several hours at least) it begins to flesh out, opens up, and loses its alcoholic edge.",90,58.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Red Blend,Brian Carter Cellars
US,"This is one of famed Pinot Noir winemaker Lane Tanner's first stabs at this grape, and she succeeds strongly in this brand with business partner Will Henry. Aromas of cherry, bark, mint candy, dried rose petal and sagebrush give way to an inviting berry pie flavor, followed by a slowly emergent herbal grip that's reminiscent of pine sap.",92,25.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Grenache,Lumen
US,"Opening with a mouthful of dusty raspberry and cherry flavors, this Bordeaux blend of a little more than half Cabernet Sauvignon and smaller percentages of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot offers much in the way of inviting fruit and spice notes. Its pleasing acidity lasts through the finish.",88,40.0,California,Livermore Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Fenestra
Italy,Here's an easy Sangiovese-based wine (with a small percent of Petit Verdot for extra darkness and color) that would pair wonderfully with stay-home pizza or pasta. The wine offers bright berry nuances of cherry and raspberry and a touch of distant spice and smoke on the fade.,86,12.0,Tuscany,Sant'Antimo,Red Blend,Fattoria Scopone

US,"Starts with a feminine, slightly floral nose that leads into strong flavors of cherry some spice and plum. It's a simple wine with a soft finish, but will be a good addition to the table if duck or mild cheeses are on the table.",82,18.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Merlot,Fulkerson
Italy,"What sets Gaja's super Tuscan apart is the extraordinary softness it offers both on the nose and in the mouth. The wine's aromas are cushiony and round, including milk chocolate, smooth cherry and silky spice. It tastes like liquid chocolate in the mouth and follows up with plump tannins and chewy succulence.",93,125.0,Tuscany,Bolgheri,Red Blend,Ca' Marcanda
Italy,"A tiny percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon and other red grapes add density and structure to this Cannonau Riserva.

The balance between fruit and barrel is perfect, and the wine is ready for near-term enjoyment.",93,40.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot,Abeja
US,"The appellation is little known because so few wines bear it, but Cabs from here, notably Laurel Glen's, are notoriously long-lived. This wine is right there in terms of ageability. It's enormously strong in tannins now, and bone dry, offering only hints of what it could be. But it's a powerful, masculine wine that should hit its stride after 2010 and hold for another decade.",91,60.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon,Martin Ray
France,"From what is always the Grand Cru that develops most quickly, this is a gorgeous, already very drinkable, ripe wine, certainly fresh. Maybe there is a more mineral character than usual, allied to higher acidity.",93,63.0,Burgundy,Chablis,Chardonnay,William Fèvre

US,"High in acidity, this single-vineyard Pinot stings the palate with tartness. Yet it's packed with rich currant, persimmon and Dr. Pepper flavors, and is dry and moderate in alcohol. Although this winery has little history, the wine may develop bottle elegance. Try after 2009.",88,49.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir,Zepaltas
Italy,Falanghina is a bright and tonic white wine and this expression from the Sannio appellation in southern Italy is no exception. The wine is driven by drying mineral tones as well as fresh aromas of apple and pear.,87,20.0,Southern Italy,Sannio,Falanghina,Mastroberardino
US,"Flirtatious on the nose with whiffs of tropical fruit, honey and a touch of lanolin, this bright golden icewine seems to vacillate between the playful and the elegant. It's rich on the tongue with honey-coated mango and papaya flavors, but retreats beautifully with a bracing lemon-lime acidity and black tea flavors that carry through a long, clean finish.",89,55.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Casa Larga
Italy,"You'll absolutely love this wine. Barbaresco Santo Stefano offers intensity, harmony and imparts delicious aromas of sweet spice, wild berries, licorice, tar and light touches of smoke or graphite. It boasts a smooth, rich texture with bright acidity on the close. This is a very pure and pristine expression of Nebbiolo that will live long in the cellar.",94,58.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Nebbiolo,Castello di Neive

Spain,"Oaky aromas of maple, blackberry and chimney grit set up a raw tannic palate. This tastes toasty and oaky, but with enough black-fruit flavor to support all that wood. Mild herb and spice flavors mix with tea and berry notes on the finish of this off-vintage Tempranillo. Drink through 2022.",91,28.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Tempranillo,Ankal

US,"With rich, fine tannins and a grilled meat edge to the blackberry, currant and black pepper flavors, this bone-dry Syrah offers lots of pleasure. If it were more concentrated, the score would soar, but still, it's a pretty elegant wine.",87,22.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Syrah,Bump Wine Cellars
France,"Smooth, rich and rounded, this is already deliciously drinkable. It offers firm tannins while keeping rich red fruits and supporting acidity firmly in the picture. Drink from 2017.",87,34.0,Burgundy,Savigny-lès-Beaune,Pinot Noir,Domaine Daniel Largeot
US,Nice bright fruit aromas and a lively play of minerality and good fresh fruit make this a definite everyday choice for fans of cleaner whites. The wine is not terribly deep but it's playful and flavorful.,83,12.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay,Sheldrake Point
Australia,"From a higher elevation—and hence cooler—region of Australia, this is a light to medium-bodied Cabernet that avoids excessive leanness, offering up a mélange of plump cassis, leather and tobacco. It's not the most powerful Cab, but offers elegance and length at an affordable price.",88,13.0,New South Wales,Southern Highlands,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cuttaway Hill Estate
US,"The wine is still showing a lot of rich new oak flavors: toast, coconut and vanilla crème. Sur lie aging (in 100% French oak) adds plenty of texture and the impression of minerality. Behind the oak is a lush mix of fruits, from tangerine and pineapple through papaya and ripe banana.",91,36.0,Washington,Washington,Chardonnay,Abeja
US,"A great wine for drinking now, this is just beginning to show the evolution of its primary blackberry, blueberry and currant fruits. Hints of anise, dark chocolate, dried herb, spices and cedar add interest. This is a blend of the classic Bordeaux varieties, but the Cabernet Sauvignon component stands front and center with its firm tannins, depth and concentration.",94,45.0,California,Alexander Valley,Meritage,Geyser Peak
US,"Mellow and complex, this is a highly approachable wine, offering butter-soft tannins, ripe fruits, and interesting highlights of grain, earth and caramel. A fine expression of the unique estate terroir.",90,30.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Syrah,Dumas Station
France,"Smooth and opulent, this immediately appeals with its generous fruit and texture that feels like velvet. The structure sits under the seductive surface, with a chocolate wood flavor, fruit tannins and density. Age for over 10 years at least.",95,180.0,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Haut-Bailly
US,"Erath's white wines are crisp and clean, if a bit simple. Light fruit flavors suggest apple more than pear, set against tart acids. This is a lean style, all stainless, perfectly drinkable but undistinguished.",85,14.0,Oregon,Oregon,Pinot Gris,Erath
Argentina,"Weird, green, spicy and odd smelling, with hard, green raisiny flavors and an herbal finish. Barely acceptable; not varietally sound or interesting.",80,10.0,Other,Tulum Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodegas Borbore
US,"A little rough around the edges, with a sweet, sugar-cured tobacco note to the tropical fruit, peach and pear flavors. But this is a good price for an everyday Chard with true varietal character.",84,10.0,California,Central Coast,Chardonnay,Grayson
Argentina,"Basic cherry and raspberry aromas have a candied tone to them, yet the palate is zesty and tart, with linear raspberry flavors that are crisp and finish like a red-fruit sucking candy. A lot of acidity and not much body. Decent but stretched thin.",83,18.0,Mendoza Province,San Carlos,Merlot,Occhioverde
US,"This is sweet, plummy and just a bit over-ripe, leaning into a sugary finish. The Sangiovese fruit is almost candied, with a finish like red hots. It's an interesting effort, but it would be a difficult match to food.",85,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sangiovese,Tagaris
US,"Soft, slightly sweet and simple, this Syrah has fairly modest blackberry, licorice flavors and cola flavors. Drink now.",85,29.0,California,Russian River Valley,Syrah,Novy
US,"The alcohol on this bottling is lower than most Fe Ciegas have been in the past, reflecting the cool vintage. The wine seems more austere than in the past, withholding a bit of the early appeal it used to show. Nonetheless, it's wonderfully structured in acids and tannins and very dry, with a judicious application of oak, and there are intricate flavors of cherries, red currants and herbs. Seems like it could shine with age, so give it six years in the cellar.",92,48.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Noir,Longoria
Italy,"This Barolo delivers simple and clean fruit tones (think cherry and raspberry) that are shrouded in delicate veils of root beer, white mushroom, bresaola, shaved mineral and dried herbs.

Drink through 2020.",92,31.0,Catalonia,Montsant,Red Blend,Portal del Montsant
US,"The g3 name honors the third generation now moving into position at the winery. Dark and spicy, supple and firm, the wine shows depth and polish.

US,"Past vintages of Barrel Thief have been red blends, but in 2004 it's labeled Cabernet Sauvignon. The rest of the blend is Cab Franc and Merlot, so the Thief has gone a bit upscale, with visions of Bordeaux dancing in its head. Screwcapped and high-toned, there's nothing shy about this wine. It hits you head-on, dumps its plain fruit flavors and runs off, leaving a bit of volatile heat in the back of your mouth.",86,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Dusted Valley
Italy,"Aromas of orange rind and lemon zest are almost overpowering and are followed by sweets tastes of mature citrus or candied fruit. In fact, this well extracted wine recalls many of the smells and tastes you get from candied orange peels.

US,"Columbia Crest winemaker Ray Einberger makes four different Chardonnays, this H3 being the newest in the lineup. It has more clean definition, more cut and precision, by far. Yes, there are light tropical fruit flavors and plenty of butter, but it's set up nicely against a firmer, peppery base.",88,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Chardonnay,Columbia Crest
US,"Maybe this wine needs some age, but right now it's strong in sweet jammy raspberries and cherries, and the oak sticks out, like a caramelized, sweet vanilla coat. Yet it has good acidity and a fine, silky structure. If only it finished drier and firmer.",85,36.0,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Pinot Noir,Woodside

Italy,"Once a sulfury note blows off, this wine reveals dark cherry fruit with licorice, tar and spice accents. Nice texture. Plum and black pepper notes add interest and the long, dry finish closes it nicely. Drinkable now, but better in a year.",86,11.0,Tuscany,Chianti Colli Senesi,Sangiovese,Fontaleoni
Argentina,"A pretty good red for those on a budget. The nose falls into the generic but pleasant raspberry and cherry realm, while the feel and flavors are of mouthfilling, mostly clean red fruit. No real varietal character but a good enough red wine.",84,8.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Shiraz,Silvertop de Argentina
US,"One of the drier, crisper white Rhône-style wines out there, and hence one of the best. These Viognier, Grenache Blanc and Marsanne blends tend to be too sweet, but this one's firm and minerally.

US,"An absolutely lovely Pinot, the best in Gainey's long career. Dry, smooth and silky, it defines Pinot's more Burgundian side, with mushroomy notes along with perfectly ripe cherries and raspberries, accented with brilliant acidity. The oak treatment is tasteful and blends in seamlessly, offering a hint of toast. The wine treads an exciting line between ripeness and earthiness, while keeping alcohol to a refreshingly low 14.1%. This is a connoisseur's wine.",95,48.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Noir,Gainey
US,"This is 100% varietal, from the Loess, Seven Hills, Pepper Bridge, and Mill Creek Upland vineyards. A deep, intense take on Merlot, it's so dark and concentrated that it dances on the )edge of bitterness, but in a style reminiscent of the finest Italian Merlots, that use that flavor to define and elucidate a dark and potent wine. In the mouth it fills out with luscious cherry and plum and blackberry fruit, baking chocolate, coconut and nougat. Yet it remains sleek and stylish, with a strong licorice note.",96,70.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Merlot,Leonetti Cellar
US,"Dry, elegantly silky and bright in acidity, this single vineyard Pinot showcases the appellation's ability to ripen Pinot grapes to a hugeness that somehow stays varietally balanced.

Argentina,"A rambunctious young buck of a wine, with untamed aromas and plenty of aggressiveness from front to back.

Now, it needs food to tame the beast.",86,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Santa Julia
Italy,"This is a very pleasurable Ripasso that opens with attractive aromas of sweet spice, nutmeg and ground clove.

It is a wine with great potential, generous tannins and the acidity of the vintage beautifully balanced. This wine will develop well. Drink from 2024.",91,22.0,Bordeaux,Moulis-en-Médoc,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Mauvesin Barton
US,"A lovely wine, soft, supple and complex. It shows ripe, forward flavors of blackberries, cassis, mushu plum sauce, chocolate and oaky smoke and vanilla, with a sweet, wild edge of lavender and violets. A true Cabernet blend, with a drop of Syrah, it has the tannic structure to improve for five years.",91,35.0,California,Mount Veeder,Cabernet Blend,Hess Collection
US,"Made sugary-sweet, with lemonade and pineapple juice flavors that are offset with crisp, coastal acidity. The grapes seem to have come from Monterey County.",84,11.0,California,California,Pinot Grigio,Five Rivers
US,"Hints of freshly pressed apples and pears in a darkly toasted oak barrel come through. Deft use of new French oak results in a full-bodied wine with a lush, buttered toast richness that highlights sweet apple and lemon flavors. The finish is clean and lemony with a slight saline touch.",85,26.0,Virginia,Virginia,Chardonnay,Barrel Oak
France,"From slopes in Chavignol and Sury-en-Vaux, this delicious wine has soft, ripe fruit, given a lift with gooseberry and green herb flavors. Crisp and light, it has complex acidity, a touch of green pea and a fine, fresh aftertaste. Imported by Henry Wine Group.",88,24.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,Sauvignon Blanc,Jean Pabiot et Fils
Italy,"This elegant Riserva expression from the Bussia cru has some ripe flavors of wild berry and raspberry followed by nicely evolved aromas of leather, spice, cola and fine Indian spice. The mouth feels tight and compact and this wine sports a long, mineral finish.",91,24.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Giacomo Fenocchio
Italy,"Passo del Lupo Riserva delivers personality and surprises thanks to its extremely polished aromas of Indian spice, red berry, natural rubber and cola. The wood integration is lovely, and the wine is both spicy and fresh on the close.",90,40.0,Central Italy,Conero,Red Blend,Fazi Battaglia
US,"Strong, distinctive and powerful, this Sauvignon Blanc explodes with gooseberry, lime zest, grapefruit, vanilla and wildflower flavors. It's light-bodied and very dry, with super acidity that makes it clean and vibrant.",86,15.0,California,Mendocino,Sauvignon Blanc,Wattle Creek
Italy,"This Chianti Classico is composed of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot. This last variety really shines through, rendering jammy aromas of cherry and blackberry followed by dense, chewy fruit.",88,22.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,Sangiovese,Villa Vignamaggio

France,"A full-bodied wine that shows some warm-vintage effects in its aromas and flavors of stewed prunes, mocha, leather and chocolate. It's mouthfilling and a bit warm on the finish. Drink now–2017.",89,36.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,Rhône-style Red Blend,Gabriel Meffre
US,"This Tempranillo-Mourvèdre-Syrah blend is smooth and captivating. The cherry-flavored fruit sports many herbal highlights, a vanilla streak, and tannins that bring an impression of soft leather. The partial fermentation in French oak brings interesting chocolatey molé flavors to the back of the throat.",90,29.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Red Blend,Isenhower
Spain,"Dry, smoky and showing a touch of leather, this is a smooth crianza with bright berry flavors, a bit of heft, and well-applied oak that doesn't overwhelm. Black cherry and raspberry flavors are bright, and the vanilla and butter elements are controlled and should subside in due time. Drink now into 2010.",89,21.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo Blend,CVNE
US,"Composed mainly of Sémillon, with some Sauvignon Blanc blended in, this is a nice wine for drinking now. It's full-bodied and tastes dryish to semi-sweet, with apricot, peach and citrus fruit flavors.",87,18.0,California,Knights Valley,Meritage,Ehret
Spain,"Unlike TG's Abadía de San Campio Albariño, this wine also features Loureira and Caiño Blanco, and it's more interesting in the long run. Aromas of mango and pineapple are sweet and pungent, while the palate is round, leesy and plump, with green melon, apple, vanilla and creamy notes. Fleshy on the finish, but with good acidity. Will accompany shellfish of all sorts.",90,24.0,Galicia,Rías Baixas,White Blend,Terras Gauda
US,"This is a dazzling Pinot Noir, so gorgeous to drink for its rich, complex deliciousness. Yet appealing as it is now, there are multiple subtleties waiting to be discovered, and the wine has a fine future. Like all of Marimar's Pinots, it's a big wine—rich and extracted and dense in weight. The flavors veer towards ripe pomegranates, black cherries and sweet licorice, with hints of dark chocolate, orange peel and even the umami of charcuterie. Despite the weight, it magically remains lithe, like a ballerina leaping into the air. Drink now–2019, as it gradually ages.",95,44.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir,Marimar Estate
France,"Dense and opulent, this is a fine, ripe wine. There is great weight here, along with flavors of nutmeg and white peach. Acidity and a firm, youthful texture all promise aging. Drink this wine from 2017.",94,65.0,Bordeaux,Sauternes,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Lafaurie-Peyraguey

The result is this crisp, richly oaked but balanced young wine. It brims with tropical fruits and spices.",92,25.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay,Gainey
US,"Coppola turns to a respected grape source for Pinot, and what do you know? This is his best ever. It's a lovely wine, supple and bright, with cherry, pomegranate and spicy persimmon flavors. The 50% new oak is perfectly integrated into the wine's power.",91,35.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Francis Coppola
US,"Drinks a little hot and overripe, with raisiny flavors, but at least it's fully dry. If these big, ripe, extracted Sierra Foothills Zins are your thing, you'll love it.",84,26.0,California,Fiddletown,Zinfandel,Martella

France,"Considerable toasted wood flavors show from both the aroma and the initial taste. The fruit is lean, without the weight needed for balance. It's likely to remain an austere wine.",84,18.0,Bordeaux,Médoc,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Lousteauneuf
Australia,"Like many McLaren Vale Shirazes, this one seems to fall somewhere between the full-blown Barossa style and the herb- and spice-driven styles of cooler climates. There's a minty edge to the blackberry fruit, espresso notes similar to those found in the northern Rhône, and firm tannins on the finish. Try after 2008.",89,21.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,Shiraz,Wayne Thomas
Spain,"Tobacco, spice and cranberry aromas mix with nutty leather and sweat. This is a tangy, choppy wine with more tomato and citrus flavor than ripe berry fruit. So even for fans of classic Rioja this will seem light, lean and leathery.",82,9.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo Blend,J. Garcia Carrion
US,"This fascinating wine is bone dry and tart in acids, with citrus, melon, fig and gooseberry flavors that finish with a rich spiciness. Be careful not to chill it too much. You might even want to decant it for a while before refrigerating. It gets better as it breathes in the glass.",90,28.0,California,Napa,Sauvignon Blanc,Spring Mountain Vineyard
US,"This is pretty tasty in cherries, cola and licorice, with a nice, silky texture. It's a polished wine that finishes dry and spicy, with a sweet oak note on the finish. A little one dimensional, but it could develop bottle complexity over the next 6–7 years.",89,35.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Windsor Oaks
US,"This rare single-vineyard, single-varietal offering of Petit Verdot has brooding aromas of high-toned flowers, fresh herbs, cherry and coffee. It's full bodied but doesn't overwhelm with its brawny, well-integrated tannins, reserved fruit flavors, bright acid and long finish.",93,55.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Petit Verdot,Rasa
France,"This velvet-textured wine, smooth and soft, has power and density, but all the edges have already smoothed away, leaving sweet hedgerow berries, dark chocolate and mint.",89,24.0,Bordeaux,Margaux,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Palmer
France,"This grand cru selection seems to have a bit of everything. Essences of mint, honeydew and apricot are perfectly integrated with flavors of apple, citrus and honey, creating a broad mouthfeel that's coating without being too heavy. A crisp clean finish cuts through the heft to prevent it from falling flat.",88,30.0,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling,Domaine Ehrhart
Australia,"Shows the warmth of the vintage in its slightly elevated alcohol levels and flavors of brandied black cherries. It's big, a bit bulky and lacking elegance, but still a chunky, flavorful mouthful of Shiraz. As predicted in our last review of this wine (8/1/05), it should drink well through 2010.",90,75.0,South Australia,Barossa,Shiraz,Peter Lehmann
Australia,"There's a slightly charry, roasted or asphalt top note to this wine's aromas, but the wine's flavors are an intriguing mix of cola, rhubarb and red berries, ending with mouthwatering raspberries coming to the fore. It's a full-bodied, creamy-textured wine that should be enjoyed over the next few years.",89,17.0,South Australia,Clare Valley,Shiraz,Wakefield Estate
US,"Properly varietal, dry and smoothly tannic, this has a ripe, rich blackberry-jam flavor, with a healthy overlay of sweet, smoky oak. It's a fine wine for drinking now.",86,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hess
France,"While it is rich and powerful, this wine also has a great presence of fresh fruits, lifted by red cherries and acidity. The texture offers red apple skins and some tight tannins.",90,24.0,Provence,Bandol,Rosé,Domaine de l'Hermitage
US,"A sinewy wine that begins with ginger, lemon curd and white peach that give way to a slightly watery palate with a silky texture and good acidity to balance the substantial residual sugar. The short-to-medium finish ends on a candied ginger note. Drink now.",86,15.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling,Bellangelo
US,"Pure, sappy wine juice is the impression this wine leaves. Although it's a 2010, it is so fresh and tangy it might have come straight from the tank. Pomegranate and raspberry are the fruit highlights, with hints of pepper and herb.",88,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Cabernet Franc,J Bell Cellars
Italy,"Oak aging (with 25% new French barrel) has helped shape sweet aromas of vanilla and exotic spice backed by loads of cherry and ripe forest berry. Characteristic aromas of violets, wet earth and graphite appear at the back and the wine is firm, thick and smooth on the close. Consider long cellar aging: 10 years or more.",93,55.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Nebbiolo,Sottimano
US,"Good, bright, spicy fruit, with fine balance and a silky, extended finish. There's lovely concentration in the back end, suggesting blackberries and loganberries and plenty of toast.",89,26.0,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel,Seghesio
Argentina,"Dusty, earthy and herbal defines the nose on this minty Cab. There are also whiffs of animal and pickle on the bouquet. This feels raw and tight, with crisp acids and peppery, lightly herbal flavors of plum and berry. A minty, dry finish is slightly harsh.",83,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tamarí
US,"Pretty basic Cabernet despite the fancy title. Shows tart flavors of blackberries, mint and chocolate.",83,15.0,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon,Parkers Estate
US,"Gorgeous, opulent, intense, a really impressive Cabernet right out of the bottle. Feels softly tannic and very dry, with enormously complex flavors of blackberries and cassis, cola, violets, minerals, cedar and unnameable tastes from the earth. A wine to savor now and cellar for a decade.",95,80.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kuleto Estate
Spain,"Concentrated aromas of earthy black fruits and cola come with a slight burn. The aggressive, full-force palate feels grating and gritty but tastes good and smoky, with cherry and berry fruit topped off with oak and mint. It's a bit high in acid, which creates a tangy sensation on the finish.",87,16.0,Levante,Alicante,Monastrell,Volver
Italy,"An odd black currant candy flavor totally dominated this wine both on the nose and palate. It seemed in balance, but the sweet cassis quality overwhelmed the wine.",84,43.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Nebbiolo,Marchesi di Barolo
France,The Jaume family's négociant business is thriving because of wines like this that faithfully represent their terroirs while offering solid value.

Argentina,"Light-bodied and more in line with traditional, quaffable Torrontès, this one offers a whiff of orange blossom and lemon in front of melon, kiwi and lime flavors.

US,"Just the kind of Sauvignon Blanc the valley produces so well. It's flavorful in citrus fruits, peaches, golden mangoes and honey, yet balanced with racy acidity. The dry, crisp finish makes it an ideal cocktail sipper.",90,20.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Longboard
US,"A simple, sugary wine, with candied berry, anise and cocoa flavors, wrapped into soft tannins.",84,19.0,California,Napa Valley,Zinfandel,Buehler
US,"You might want to give this young Zin a year or two in the cellar. Right now, it's forward and jammy in berry, cherry, chocolate and spice flavors, and feels a bit heavy and soft. The vineyard interestingly faces west, toward the hottest afternoon sun.",90,34.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel,Dry Creek Vineyard
US,"A compact wine, with more than a trace of sweaty saddle, along with red currant, herbs and spice. Depending upon your liking for barnyard notes, this could warrant a higher score.",87,23.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Snoqualmie

Australia,"Full bodied and supple, this is one of the more opulent and open of d'Arenberg's array of single-vineyard wines. Notes of vanilla, maple syrup and bramble berries mark the nose, while the flavors add cassis and tobacco elements. It's a pretty, fleshy wine for drinking now–2020, although it may age well even past that.",91,85.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,Shiraz,D'Arenberg

US,"When first opened, despite significant bottle age, it's a bit stubborn, tannic, hard, and showing some heat, iron, black olive, and earth. But with aggressive decanting (several hours at least) it begins to flesh out, opens up, and loses its alcoholic edge.",90,58.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Red Blend,Brian Carter Cellars

US,"This is a very rich Chardonnay, almost too elaborated and overworked. It's tremendous in oak-infused fruit, with dominating buttered toast, crème brûlée and pineapple pie flavors. Very crisp coastal acidity provides a pleasant balance of tartness. Drink now.",89,40.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay,La Fenêtre
France,The wine has bold fruit and ripe tannins. There is still a strong flavor from the wood aging although this should integrate. The fruit is the dominant character of this red-berry flavored wine. Drink from 2021.,89,49.0,Bordeaux,Pomerol,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Plince
Italy,Here's a wine that would pair beautifully with rosemary-marinated lamb or succulent pork tenderloin. It offers balanced aromas of fresh berry fruit versus oak-driven spice and ends with plush tannins and a silky mouthfeel.,88,24.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese Grosso,Fossacolle

Spain,"This aromatic Priorat is 72% Carignan and the rest Garnacha. Aromas of floral bath soap, cinnamon and cedar accent plum and berry scents. In the mouth, this is built like a tank.

US,"This blend of 71% Roussanne, 21% Grenache Blanc and 8% Picpoul Blanc offers cut Meyer lemon, tangerine and pink-grapefruit aromas on the nose, along with the promise of a creamy palate. Instead, the palate is quite tight and restrained, starting tart but opening toward lemon rinds and pear flesh, and wiping up clean on the finish.",90,45.0,California,Paso Robles,Rhône-style White Blend,Tablas Creek
France,"Begins with modest apple and nectarine scents, then delivers bland stone fruit flavors in a plump, low-acid format that's easy to drink, as long as it's well chilled. Shows the ripeness of the 2003 vintage, but lacks concentration.",84,10.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Blanc,Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon,J. D. Laurent
Spain,"A rewarding wine that isn't overly pricey or difficult to enjoy. Dark, lightly baked aromas hint at raisin and marshmallow, while the palate has a deep texture and vital acidity. Savory, tea-infused flavors bring pulse and kick, and as a whole it delivers a true reflection of what Ribera del Duero should be.",91,21.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Tempranillo Blend,Bodegas y Viñedos Tábula
US,"The winery rarely produces single-vineyard bubblies, so when they do, it's because their team believes in the bottling. And when you taste this 100% Chardonnay, you understand why. It's dry and rich in acidity, with yeasty lees and toast that frame gorgeous tangerine, Meyer lemon, lime and vanilla bean flavors. The mousse is ultrarefined, making it great for drinking now. This sparking wine could age until at least 2024, gradually losing effervescence and primary fruit but gaining in subtlety.",96,70.0,California,Carneros,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg
US,"Whatever the grape varieties in this wine are, and the winery doesn't identify them, they're of the full-bodied type, like Petite Sirah or Zinfandel.

US,"Here's a big, tough, tannic and dry wine, a classic example of a young Barbera that will live for decades. It will never be a great wine, but will soften and sweeten over many years, gradually yielding sweet dried fruit, flower and spice pleasantries.",87,24.0,California,Amador County,Barbera,Hatcher
France,"Ripely rich, this is full of soft fruit, with a dominant note of apricot. It has just a touch of spice to add piquancy, while the smooth texture is given a tight edge by a lemon juice flavor.

US,"A wisp of a wine, like Marilyn in her All About Eve years, before the buxom bravado kicked in. Clean, light in color, with an inviting floral aroma, this gentle wine is dry and delicious. Pair with shellfish and think of the star's more innocent years.",89,16.0,California,Lake County,Sauvignon Blanc,Marilyn Sauvignon Blonde
Italy,"This edition of Mater Matuta shows more sophistication and harmony and proves that this well-loved Syrah-Petit Verdot blend from Lazio benefits from two or three years of bottle aging. The wine is bold and ripe with raw fruit flavors and offers chewy, soft tannins on the close.",90,57.0,Central Italy,Lazio,Red Blend,Casale del Giglio

US,"Wonderfully smooth in the mouth, all satin and velvet, and so dry and crisp, it makes your mouth water. Good flavors, too, suggesting freshly picked wild blackberries, anise and black pepper.

France,"So smooth, this is a rich, grandiose wine. Although it is full of black currant fruits and spice flavors, the texture is most impressive. Dusty tannins are integrated with juicy fruits seamlessly. The purest fruit flavors are allied to linear tannins in a precise yet generous way. The wine is evolving beautifully, but do not drink before 2020.",96,105.0,Bordeaux,Pauillac,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Pontet-Canet

Absolutely delightful now.",92,49.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"Malvasia is an aromatic variety, like Riesling or Muscat. This wine is bone dry and brims with mouth-cleansing acidity. Flavorwise, it's all oranges and tangerines, with hints of honeysuckle and white pepper. There's something tangy and layered that makes it terrifically interesting. Try as a refreshing alternative to tart wines, like Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio.",90,15.0,California,Monterey,Malvasia Bianca,Birichino
France,"With some extra weight, this is a solid, red currant and berry driven wine. Its fruit is right up front, backed by a mineral acidity that cuts through the richness.

US,"Really delicious, a sweet, spicy, fruity wine that's like biting into a raspberry, roasted almond, vanilla and cinnamon granola candy bar. That's no insult.

Argentina,"California winemaker Patrick Campbell makes this perfumed, unusual Chardonnay, which is challenged but ultimately proves its worth. While it's nothing like Burgundy or other varietally correct Chards, it does show sweet melon, mango and other candied flavors. More for those wanting a simple, sweeter style.",84,9.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Chardonnay,Terra Buena

Spain,"Despite basic strawberry and red licorice aromas, this wine is decidedly tart. It hits with snappy nectarine flavors and then turns citric and finishes up sour. Doesn't offer much rosé pleasure; makes you wonder what's the point.",81,11.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,Tempranillo,Rivera de Castilla
US,"Much different from last year's bottling, and better, but also more expensive. It's a big, rich, Rhônish Pinot that requires some age to calm down. Shows tannic flavors of cherries, blackberries, cola, anise, sassafras and sandalwood.",89,36.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir,Baker Lane
Spain,"Hard and earthy, with black fruit aromas that are big but closed. The palate is short, stocky and blocky, with mammoth but basic flavors that turn rubbery. Not much of a finish to speak of.",83,15.0,Northern Spain,Toro,Tinta de Toro,El Curato

US,"A blend of 60% Montepulciano and 40% Sangiovese, this is a grippy, leathery wine, the fruit sourced from two different sites in the appellation.

France,"An interesting Chard that offers quite sweet notes of stewed peaches, orange marmalade and overripe honeydew.

Italy,"Here's a nicely aged red blend that boasts thick aromatic intensity and penetrating notes of ripe fruit, spice and loads of oak shadings in the form of vanilla bean and dark chocolate. The wine has a thick meaty quality, back by power and concentration and a chewy, syrupy consistency. You'll feel its weight on the palate.",91,24.0,Tuscany,Colli della Toscana Centrale,Red Blend,I Balzini

France,"You can tell this is going to be sweet by its gold color. And there's no deception, except along with that sweetness there is a surprising (and delightful) freshness, which comes from sweet apple juice acidity. The toffee is more obvious than the honey, but this remains a fresh, vivid wine.",92,24.0,Loire Valley,Coteaux du Layon,Chenin Blanc,Domaine Philippe Delesvaux

US,"A few years of bottle age have softened and mellowed this Chard, making it very nice for drinking now. It has lovely orange, Asian pear and mango flavors, with just the right touch of oak, and a rich, creamy mouthfeel.",89,30.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay,Kenneth Volk
France,"Finely balanced, this wine brings together rich, red fruits, a core of dry tannins and a delicious fresh acidity in a harmonious whole. Maybe that means its aging period will be short, but for drinking over the next 2–3 years, this is already very attractive.",92,75.0,Burgundy,Beaune,Pinot Noir,Albert Morot
US,"This wine has a restrained nose, featuring wooly aromas of leather, wild berry and cherry. The light- to medium-bodied palate has supple, fine-grained tannins, with light flavors of savory spice and grilled herb. A note of macerated strawberry lingers on the finish.",84,20.0,Virginia,Virginia,Petit Verdot,Chateau Morrisette
US,"The hope and prayer of this wine is that it will age, because right now it's kind of aggressive. The tannins are very strong and astringent, and they seem out of place with the ripe, jammy fruitiness you usually find in softer wines. May be better after a few years.",85,55.0,California,Paso Robles,Petite Sirah,EOS
Spain,"Rubbery, jammy and dark on the nose, then juicy, fresh and linear in the mouth.

Spain,"With the exact same rating as the awesome 2004, this new vintage of Aurus is an unbridled winner. It's a little creamy and sweet on first blush, but time and air reveals its darker, more serious side. Flavors of blackberry, barbecued beef and fudge tell all you need to know about ripeness and richness, and among the new classics of Rioja, Aurus is one of the leaders. Drink now and over the next three years. It's not really for long-term cellaring.",94,248.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo Blend,Finca Allende
Australia,"A great representative of Australian Grenache, with flavors of black fruit, road tar and raspberry liqueur fading to a palate of brambly fruit, all of which is couched in mocha and vanilla tones from toasty French oak.

France,"Pfersigberg, the hill of peach trees, is an apt name for this ripe wine. Yellow and tropical fruits show strongly along with spice, bergamot and concentration from the 50-year-old vines in the wine.

US,"This massive, explosive Chardonnay is marked by extremely ripe pineapple, pear and peach fruit, accented with lots of sweet, caramelized oak.

A bit obvious, but a fine example of its style.",92,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay,Sbragia

A textbook sweet, simple South American Chardonnay with a tropical leaning and finishing flavors of pineapple.",84,10.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Chardonnay,Finca El Portillo
France,"Brun packs a lot of complexity into this wine. Briary, stemmy aromas add a wild touch to the crystalline black fruit, and those same elements re-emerge on the long finish.

US,"Although there's no oak on this wine, it has a spicy smokiness that could come from a drop of Grenache. There are also percentages of Chardonnay and Pinot Gris that fatten Sauvignon's minerals and limes. Acidity is mouthwateringly high. This isn't a great wine, but it is a unique one, especially for Santa Rita Hills.",87,18.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Sauvignon Blanc,Babcock
US,"A decent, everyday Chardonnay. Tastes dryish, with pineapple and caramel flavors.",83,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay,Amphora

US,"Somehow, this California winery manages to put out the best budget Syrah in all of Washington State. Pure varietal, this excellent bottle brings clean berry fruit, natural acids and moderate tannins into play, with none of the bizarrely sweet vanilla and tobacco flavors that typically show up on Yellowtail wannabes. This wine just wants to be what it is—affordable, juicy and nicely representative of the higher acid, food-ready flavors of Washington state grapes.",88,10.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah,Castle Rock
Italy,"Not bad for a first attempt. This is a thick, dark wine of almost impenetrable extraction and mature fruit notes of black cherry and black currant. Its aromas are painted in broad brush strokes and invoke roasted espresso bean, black chocolate and smoked game. It has an outstanding mouthfeel, with voluptuous but solid tannins and enormous length. Drink after 2015.",95,66.0,Tuscany,Bolgheri Superiore,Red Blend,Podere Sapaio
US,"This is the most expensive of N&N;'s current Cab lineup and also a remarkably good wine. It combines flamboyantly ripe fruit with a fine, rich structure and balance, although it's a little soft. The complex flavors of blackberries, blueberries and cherries are well-oaked, and the finish is long and spicy.",92,130.0,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon,Nickel & Nickel

Argentina,"A bit rusty in color and mature, but that's what makes this wine different than most. It's earthy, a bit leathery and muddled, and slightly baked. But it's also subdued, mellow and sturdy, with lighter tannins and hints of herbs to go with finely roasted berry and tomato flavors. Integrated, long and spicy late. Drink now through 2012.",90,22.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Weinert

Spain,"This mature wine is rusty in color and burnt and stalky smelling, with gritty fruit aromas. In the mouth, it's flabby and lacks structure, while the flavor profile is earthy, with herbal berry flavors. Carob and herbal notes are the finishing flavors.",85,30.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,Red Blend,Ochoa

Italy,"The Damilano is a modern take on Barbera; a big, very ripe, chunky wine that is easy to like. The fruit is thick with dark jammy flavors, and although there are hints of something more exotic lurking, at the moment all you have is a hint of spice. Easy to drink now, but worth cellaring for a couple of years, as it will prove to be more interesting with some bottle age.",88,18.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,Barbera,Damilano
Spain,"Classic old-school Gran Reserva. The nose is full of barbecue, molasses and dried plum, while the palate has complexities in the form of tobacco, tire rubber and earth.

Drink now or hold for another 5 years.",88,25.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo,Marques de Arienzo
Spain,"Maturing fairly well, with brown edges to the wine's earthy hue. The nose is rooty and deep, but there's a definite cheesy, mildly bretty accent to it.

US,"There was no slippage for Stella in this second vintage; in fact, it's a clear step up from the 2003. 88% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 2% Petit Verdot, this titillates with sweet raspberry fruit, leading into chocolate and cherry. It's a lively, delicious wine, that tops out at 14.5% alcohol.",90,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend,Stella Maris
US,"This lush, intricate and complex Pinot Noir really brings out the best of Russian River Valley. The fruit is enormously ripe, suggesting mashed cherries, blackberry jam, red licorice, cola and peppery spices, and the tannin-acid structure is just about perfect. The texture is right down the middle between silky-light and full-bodied. Beautiful now and through 2012.",93,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,WesMar

A licorice note closes the finish.",90,120.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese,Seconda Stella a Destra
France,"With just a touch of yellow fruits, this is a ripe, concentrated wine. It has something of the Chablis minerality that is combined with intense fruits and acidity. The wine is young but very drinkable now, although likely to age at least until 2020.",88,26.0,Burgundy,Chablis,Chardonnay,Domaine George

US,"Shows all the hallmarks of great Mondavi Reserve. Ageworthy and complex, with enormously ripe, rich fruit, classic chocolate, cassis plus cream and spice from new oak.

France,"The heavy bottle, as so often, is the giveaway: This is meant as an important statement. The wine comes from a small parcel of vines owned by Cambon la Pelouse in Margaux.

Australia,"Sidewood's 2009 Chardonnay is a throwback to the sort of delicious, well-priced Chardonnays Australia used to be known for, but with a touch more class.

Italy,"The Brunate cru with its excellent exposure and thicker soils is usually known for its hearty, deeply concentrated wines.

France,"Disgorged in 2009, this is a toasty wine, rich and concentrated. The idea of long aging before disgorging the yeast cells is to build up the unique complexity of the wine. In this Bollinger has succeeded magnificently. An opulent wine, with aging potential for 10 years or more.",97,260.0,Champagne,Champagne,Champagne Blend,Bollinger

US,"There are admirable qualities of dryness, crispness and true varietal silkiness, with good cola, blackberry, spicy coffee and unsweetened chocolate flavors. But there's something bitter, astringent and heavy that puts me off. Could do something in time, but it's already nearly four years old.",85,48.0,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,Carneros della Notte
US,"Smells porty-rich in white chocolate, fudge, vanilla, smoky char and fruit. Enormously rich, almost decadent flavors of chocolate, cherries, blueberries. So big. Needs time to knit together. Hold until 2008. Earns its points on sheer volume.",93,24.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir,Pisoni

US,"Tart and leafy, this pure Malbec shows good grip and concentration. Sour raspberry fruit flavors and sharp acids are complemented with barrel spice from aging in once-used French oak.

US,"Making a balanced, delicious Petite Sirah is hard anywhere, much less in a hot place like Paso Robles, but Filice has risen to the challenge. The wine shows Pet's huge, lush blackberry, boysenberry, plum and coffee fruit, complexed with dark chocolate and seasoned with Asian spices. Yet it remains dry and elegant. This is really great Petite Sirah.",93,26.0,California,Paso Robles,Petite Sirah,La Filice
US,"This outstanding Walla Walla boutique has established a track record for consistent improvement, and the white wines are best of show. Once again this 2006 blend is smooth, round and richly endowed with mixed stone fruits. Lovely aromas build a dense cloud of complex fruit, toast and caramel scents around the glass; once in the mouth the full-bodied fruit takes hold with lychee, peach and stone fruits. Immaculate and persistent, this stunning wine just keeps on coming.",92,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),White Blend,Buty

US,"This is the first red wine to be released that was made by winemaker Christophe Paubert, and it points the way to a very bright future. Roughly two thirds Merlot and one third Cabernet Sauvignon, this fresh young wine is the color of black cherry soda, and tastes like black cherry candy. Tannins are supple and light, with just a hint of toffee as the wine winds down gracefully. Fine value.",89,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Red Blend,Canoe Ridge
US,"You'll want to give this vigorous young Cab time in the cellar to come around. It's tannic and closed now, and the blackberry and cherry fruit has a primary fruit jamminess that wants to develop some bottle-aged characteristics. Give it until 2017 to begin to come around.",92,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Krutz
US,"Lovely aromas are a perfect mix of dust, rock, cassis and black fruits; the flavors carry so much detail that it's hard to catalog it all. Subtle but well defined, they cascade over and around each other in a gentle profusion—there is black cherry, then rock, then lead pencil, then some smoke, then a whiff of licorice, and so on.

US,"With crushed pineapple flavors enhanced with a bit of oak, this wine gets the tastebuds watering. It has fine balance, elegance and varietal character. The winemaker recommends poached salmon, which, with a sprig of dill and a squirt of lemon, seems perfect.",88,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay,Raymond
US,"Spicy black fruit, with bell pepper, black pepper and toast adding complexity. Partial whole-berry fermentation brings an element of spicy, forward fruitiness to the wine.

US,"Jewell threads the needle where so many others fail with this dry, elegant Sauvignon Blanc. Does exactly what it should, providing a mouthwateringly crisp white wine that scours and cleanses the palate. The flavors are of limes, lemons, grapefruits, wildflowers and stony, tangy minerals. Really a brilliant wine, among the best of its class.",93,24.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Joseph Jewell
Argentina,"Here's one heck of a black, saturated wine. Cola and tar aromas abound, while the palate is borderline medicinal due to its extreme ripeness. If you like a rich, sun-drenched red with heft and body, this is it. The blend is 80% Malbec and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, and it hails from vines with up to 150 years of history behind them. Weighs in at a whopping 15.5%.",92,90.0,Other,Calchaquí Valley,Red Blend,Colomé

The mouthfeel is clean, polished and crisp.",88,24.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Red Blend,Casa di Terra

Spain,"Earthy berry and licorice aromas are composed, lightly oaked and attractive. This standard Priorato blend of Grenache, Carignan and Syrah is fresh feeling, with a bolt of bracing acidity. Juicy plum and raspberry flavors finish loamy, earthy and balanced. For a wine that's no heavyweight, this is strong throughout. Drink through 2018.",89,23.0,Catalonia,Priorat,Red Blend,Vega Escal
Spain,"Jumps out of the chute with baked, earthy, funky aromas that are more savory and spicy than outright fruity.

Good in a subtle, earthy, nonfruity way.",87,19.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Tempranillo,Prado Rey

US,"The impression is of a young, tannicly closed but enormously promising Cabernet. Floods the mouth with dramatic black currant, cherry and chocolate flavors, masses of toasty, caramelized new oak, and a rich, minerally earthiness. For all the power, there's elegance and refinement. If you must drink it now, decant it; best 2008–2015.",97,190.0,California,Stags Leap District,Cabernet Sauvignon,Shafer

Italy,"Despite its young age now, the 2006 Dardi Le Rose Bussia Barolo will go on record as a classy, charming wine with long aging potential. The mineral tones are well etched and are followed by luscious layers of red fruit and spice. The tannins still need time to soften.",91,73.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Poderi Colla
US,"Quite tart and citrusy, this is a pleasant wine that offers clean and refreshing flavors of melon, grapefruit and gin. It's not an insubstantial wine, but it does not have the fleshy fruit that Willamette Valley Gris usually shows; this is a leaner style that's well suited to shellfish.",86,17.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Pinot Gris,Brandborg

US,"This is a blend of 70% Merlot, with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Mourvèdre. It spent almost two years in 60% new oak, and the oak dominates both the nose and the palate.

US,"The '06 had a hard act to follow after the classic 2005. It's not as great a Pinot Noir, showing a tannic brittleness and heaviness despite a rich undertow of red currants, mocha and spices. As good as it is, it lacks a refined elegance, and its hope lies in the cellar.",88,70.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Pinot Noir,Talley
US,"The roaring nose shows enormous concentration and depth, with licorice, plum and oak shadings. The mouthfeel is big and jammy, but the fruit is well defined, with a sweet-tart quality and dark coffee accents. Almost seems overmature, but truly flavorful and inviting already.",93,36.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bartholomew Park
Italy,"The Valdinara is a soft, seductive wine showing plenty of jammy fruit, and a pleasant smoky spice.

US,"An off-dry, leesy, delicately floral Riesling, this elegantly captures the floral and mineral qualities that make the grape so exceptional. The wine doesn't push too hard, but it persists, mixing white peach and papaya with citrus blossom, rosewater and body powder. Exotic and delightful.",90,12.0,Washington,Washington,Riesling,Milbrandt
US,"A World War II–era pinup, caught mid-salute with a glass of wine in her left hand, makes this one of the more eye-catching labels to hit the shelf this year. It's a solid effort, which could pass for a Merlot if it had the requisite 75%. Chunky, cherry/chocolate flavored, and quite delightful.",88,16.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Red Blend,Airfield Estates
US,"Smooth and velvety, with chocolate-cherry flavors, but the sweetness tails off quickly, disappointing the palate. Good and sound, but lacks the continuing richness you want in a true Port-style wine, especially at this price.",85,52.0,California,Napa Valley,Port,Prager
US,"This wine would compare favorably with the least expensive Sauv Blancs from New Zealand or Chile. It avoids the unripe pea vine or asparagus flavors that can afflict those wines, and brings light, fresh, sweetly grassy flavors to the palate. A little unfocused, but pleasurable and crisp, this is a good all-purpose seafood wine.",85,8.0,Washington,Washington,Sauvignon Blanc,Columbia Crest
US,"There is nothing especially wrong here, but it is such a predictable, monolithic, corporate wine that it's hard to get very excited. Clean fruit and soft, buttery flavors, along with vanilla and banana, seem calculated rather than crafted. Safe and solid.",85,9.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay,Hogue

France,"While it's light, this Marsannay, from the northernmost appellation of the Côte de Nuits, gives warm, soft pleasure. The fruit has fresh berry and sweet jam flavors, followed by a layer of dryness that is not excessive and an attractive lively finish.",88,19.0,Burgundy,Marsannay,Pinot Noir,Louis Latour
US,"This is dark and slightly murky, with sweet scents of cooked fruits and baking spices. Somehow it keeps the alcohol levels well down (13%) but the fruit flavors are ultra-ripe, pruney, and deep. There is a good long finish that delves into soy, earth, baking chocolate, vanilla and clove, and is undeniably fascinating. This is not a wine that will ring everyone's bell, but it offers a lot of flavor.",86,20.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Franc,Lone Canary
US,"Somewhat raisiny and bitter. Tastes like press wine, with harsh, grapeskin tannins that make it feel astringently dry. Pretty good flavors, though, of blackberries and currants. Drink up.",85,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Paoletti

US,"Although it has spent quite a bit of time in bottle, this wine still seems overweighted to its oak – the barrel flavors, woody and slightly bitter, overwhelm the golden apple fruit. It seems to be fading already, a bit past its peak.",85,32.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay,Chehalem
Italy,The celebrated Poggio alle Mura Brunello delivers hearty masculine richness and deep layers of sassy spice that are offset by plush blackberry and cherry nuances. The wine shows solid structure that will soften with careful cellar aging.,94,82.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese Grosso,Castello Banfi
Spain,"Excellent Ribera crianza here. It has a smooth, appealing bouquet of candied berry fruit, which is followed by a rich palate of cassis, black cherry, prune, chocolate and coffee.

Spain,"Ripe, oaky aromas settle on prune, raisin and baked plum. As the nose indicates, this is a ripe, plump wine, although a shock of acidity keeps it balanced.

Spain,"The neon pink color is a dead giveaway that Garnacha is the basis of this rosé. Smells spunky and quite fresh on the nose, with a touch of bubble-gum sweetness. Flavors of raspberry and cotton candy catch the tart and sweet sides of things, so overall it's offering a little of everything. Drink now.",86,11.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Rosé,Ilurce

US,"Tastes honey sweet in butterscotch, buttered toast and caramel. The sweetness dominates well ripened pineapple and tangerine flavors. But the fruity power is there.

US,"Typically Calera's most luscious, delicious wine in youth. The year 2007 was kind, and the result is a Pinot rich in cherries, raspberries, licorice and cola, wrapped into a silky texture, with near perfect acids and tannins.

US,"If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the—oh…I mean…coladas and ripe banana, caramel and pear aromas and flavors, then this wine delivers.

Italy,"Although this Brunello is from the newly released 2005 vintage, it has aromas and textures that remind you of a wine that is older still.

There are big tannins over here, oak over there, and sandwiched in between are huge, intense flavors of blackberry, blueberry and cassis liqueur.

France,"A full-bodied wine, rich and with peach and pear fruits as well as more citrus character.

It does need aging over at least four years.",91,27.0,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling,André Blanck et ses Fils

US,"This 100% Cabernet is a good wine, rich in blackberry, black currant and new oak flavors, and the tannins show that famous Stags Leap “iron fist in a velvet glove” quality.

US,"Though it lacks the precision of a single-vineyard Syrah (a grape that meticulously reflects individual terroir), this is balanced, clean and unmistakably varietal. There is a spicy, sharply herbal underpinning and tannins that suggest some stems in the fermentation. The high alcohol does not intrude, and the wine is complete and full.",89,55.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah,Corliss Estates
US,"A gorgeous Chardonnay, flamboyant in tropical fruit, honey, cream and buttered toast, but so balanced in acids and minerals, so clean and pure, that it ventures into truly classic territory.

One of the best Chardonnays Testarossa has ever produced.",95,39.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Chardonnay,Testarossa

US,"Virginia's 2010 harvest brought intense heat and little rain, making for many ripe, powerful wines, such as this Cabernet Franc. Aromas of blackberry cobbler, jammy blueberry, caramel and vanilla lead to a medium- to full-bodied palate that bears muscular tannins and lush acids. This is a big boy in terms of alcohol, clocking in at 15.8%, which makes for a warm finish.",87,24.0,Virginia,Virginia,Cabernet Franc,Breaux

Australia,"This wine's back label talks a big game: “If you can find a bigger wine, buy it!” At 16.5% alcohol, it's a big wine that wears its size well (but you don't have to go far to find a bigger wine—Warrabilla's Paola's bottling is a percent higher in alcohol). Medium-sized and flavorful, with dense purple fruit and soft tannins, this wine is moderate, not superrich, and best that way.",88,40.0,Victoria,Rutherglen,Durif,Warrabilla
Australia,"The aromas of this wine are undoubtedly complex: meaty, stewy, cedary and jammy—there's a lot going on, just not all going in the same direction. Yet it seems to come together on the palate, where it offers a creamy, mouthfilling texture, turning chewier on the finish. Hints of chocolate, coffee, molasses, mixed berries and peppery spice make for a rich, intense blend of flavors. Drink now–2020.",91,38.0,South Australia,Langhorne Creek,Shiraz,Brothers in Arms

Italy,"Winemaker Romano Dal Forno fearlessly confronted the soggy 2002 vintage with high extraction techniques and barrique aging (36 months). This is an inky, dense wine (more syrupy than it is vinous) with black currant, peppermill, chocolate fudge and big firm wood tannins. It is so monolithic, a viable food match is virtually impossible. As always, Dal Forno straddles a fine line between brilliance and exaggeration.",90,535.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Dal Forno Romano

US,"This is just now being released, unblended Yakima Valley Syrah, with tight, almost impenetrably hard red fruits.

US,"Ballentine consistently makes one of the best Chenins in California, and while this 2009 seems rushed to market, it's a good alternative to Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio.

Italy,"Costa Grimaldi is a spectacular wine that surprises with every sip thanks to its intensity and the extraordinary quality of its mouthfeel.

US,"This would qualify as a fruit bomb except it is so impeccably balanced, with fine-grained tannins and enough acidity to keep the lush berry fruit flavors from becoming jammy. Boysenberry, blackberry, black cherry and cassis hold down a concentrated core; the density of this wine is captivating.",94,35.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Syrah,K Vintners
US,"This new lineup from Columbia Crest features fruit exclusively from the Horse Heaven Hills AVA, which provides a welcome focus to the wines. Fruit-powered, but more substantial than either the Grand Estates or the Two Vines, this shows persistent flavors of tangy raspberry and blackberry, moderate acids and plenty of cocoa in the finish.",88,15.0,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Merlot,Columbia Crest
US,"Light and forward, this has a slightly cooked, raisiny character, along with chewy tannins. It does lack the elegance and grace that should characterize Pinot Noir. The tannins are too rough for the fruit.",84,27.0,Washington,Washington,Pinot Noir,Chateau Faire Le Pont
US,"The line between tart gooseberries and that strong ammonia smell is a thin one. This Sauvignon Blanc steps just over the edge. The price is fine, and the wine is dry and crisp in citrus fruit flavors, but it is a little too green.",84,14.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Souverain
Italy,A clean and simple wine defined by crisp grapefruit and honeysuckle notes. Some of the appeal waned in the mouth because of its lean and neutral appearance.,84,16.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,Pinot Grigio,H. Lun Winery
US,"A bit on the dry, tannic side, this Syrah's astringency hides a rich core of blackberry and black cherry fruit. It's really too hard to enjoy now. Decant for hours, or try the cellar, although that's a gamble.",85,25.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Syrah,La Fenêtre
Italy,Here is a simple and one-dimensional Prosecco that doles out citrus and honey. Try it with salted finger foods.,84,15.0,Veneto,Prosecco,Glera,Foss Marai
France,"This is a youthful, fruity wine with crisp yellow-fruit and citrus flavors, with a toastiness from wood aging. Sourced from Saint-Aubin, it has a cool, fresh feel that complements its pristine fruitiness. It's for drinking soon, but will also improve with age through 2021.",91,43.0,Burgundy,Saint-Aubin,Chardonnay,Jean-Claude Boisset
US,"Quite elegant, but not showing well given the price, being somewhat soft and direct in candied blackberries, cherries and chocolate-covered mint. The vintage was a difficult one for St. Supéry.

Drink through 2019.",89,39.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,CarlindePaolo
US,"No one does a better job with the Syrah from this vineyard than Mark Ryan McNeilly. Here, the peppery, just-ripe fruit is washed in a caramel bath.

US,"Dry and somewhat herbaceous, this Chardonnay has some good pear, melon and orange fruit, but otherwise is missing out on opulence, especially at this price. New oak, to the tune of 40%, contributes buttered toast and caramel, but the wine needs more than that.",86,42.0,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay,Grgich Hills

Would be better with more purity.",84,14.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Tempranillo,Pomar Viñedos

US,"The artist label Syrah is usually Dunham's best, as this vineyard is well-established as one of the premier sites in Washington for Syrah. Scents of violets and black cherry introduce a dense, hard, tightly wound, muscular effort that needs a generous amount of breathing time.

It's plush, rich and extremely long-lasting.",94,130.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Red Blend,Monteverro

Australia,"An unusual blend that includes 25% Petit Verdot, the Kurtz Family's Seven Sleepers features an intense, welcoming bouquet of black cherries, cinnamon and coffee backed by cherry fruit and earthy flavors. It's got enough muscle to stand up to steaks and burgers, and should drink well through 2016.",88,18.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,Red Blend,Kurtz Family
US,"Give this wine credit for the sheer power of its fruit. Swamps the palate with freshly crushed raspberry and cherry flavors, liberally enriched with sweet vanilla and caramelized oak.

US,"First made in 2006, this succulent luscious Chardonnay is all about minerality. It's got a rich core of butterscotch and the seemingly endless layers of subtle flavors that biodynamic farming can bring. It spends 18 months on the lees prior to bottling.

US,"Not the most successful Rosella's Pinot ever. The flavors are rich enough, suggesting raspberries, cherries and cola, and the wine is dry and silky. But there's an acidic sharpness, reminiscent of mint jelly, that deranges the palate.",86,59.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir,Testarossa

France,"Still young, this powerful wine has intense steely minerality to go with its almost stark green fruits. It has a great texture, edged with acidity, and a light toast character. A wine for aging.",93,81.0,Burgundy,Chablis,Chardonnay,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils
US,"A crisp wine, dry and clean, with citrus, green apple and lemongrass flavors. A small percentage of new oak adds toast, while sur lie aging brings a tart creaminess.

US,"Perhaps because the winery's co-owner, Frank Ostini, is a restaurateur, he makes his wines in a forward, approachable style that doesn't require aging, although they're balanced enough for the cellar. The '06 Rio Vista is a fresh, silky wine whose smoky cherry and pepperspice flavors will soar with a grilled steak. Should hold nicely for six years.",92,42.0,California,Sta.

US,"This is a sweet, simple sparkling wine made from 60% Chenin Blanc and 40% Chardonnay. It has a lemon/citrus nose, with some soapy scents that carry through in the flavor. The big bubbles and sugary mouthfeel suggest that it was made by the charmat process; in any event, it's a bubbly best suited for mixing with orange juice or something tart like cranberry juice, and served as a Sunday morning spirit-lifter.",81,8.0,Idaho,Idaho,Champagne Blend,Ste.

US,"This opens with a very pretty nose—scents of clay, mineral, blueberry, cassis and a whiff of rather high-toned volatility. In the mouth the barrel flavors bring dusty cocoa and chocolate.

US,"This Cab Franc-Merlot blend is beautifully aromatic, with sappy fruit flavors in a clearly identifiable Cayuse style. Rich strawberry-inflected fruit, sour cherry (griotte), dried herbs and a lightly salty texture infuse a wine that also packs in plenty of the earthy, compost character of Cayuse. Tannins are already beginning to age into a finish with black tea highlights.",93,70.0,Oregon,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Cabernet Merlot,Cayuse

It has a wide, broad approach and very far-reaching intensity. But it also has many burnt wood nuances that boarder on being too heavy, especially considering the wine's delicate core of red fruit.

The husband and wife team, with no prior winemaking experience, admit that at the beginning, “We made all the mistakes we could.” They've certainly come a long way. This wine is fragrant and spicy, filled with scents of garrigue, baking spices and anise, yet at the same time showing plenty of ripe, mouthfilling fruit. Elegant, complex and a fantastic value.",91,14.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône Villages,Rhône-style Red Blend,Domaine de la Guicharde

France,"Devaux makes a yeasty, bubbly, straight-ahead style of Champagne. It's tart and tastes mostly of green apples, with just a faint hint of toast in the finish. There's nothing particularly distinctive here, but it is well-made, refreshing and crisp through a clean finish.",87,35.0,Champagne,Champagne,Champagne Blend,Devaux

US,"This vintage of Trésor is the winery's best in years. A Bordeaux-style blend that's based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this is softly tannic and rich, and it offers layers of cherry pie, mocha and smoky cedar. Best to enjoy now for its sheer drinkability.",93,52.0,California,Sonoma County,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Ferrari-Carano

US,"Made from 100% Cabernet grown in a hilly part of the valley, this wine is tight and dry in tannins. It's so astringent, it's nearly impossible to enjoy now. Yet it's extraordinarily rich and explosive in blackberry tart, black cherry pie and cassis flavors, and feels dramatic in the mouth. Should easily improve over the next decade. Hold until 2013.",94,75.0,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong

Italy,"With a long winemaking history that spans back to 1908, the Germano family has played an important role in the evolution of Barolo and Langhe wines.

The mouthfeel is equally impressive thanks to the polished and drying nature of the tannins.",94,24.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Germano Angelo
Italy,"Here's an excellent measuring stick with which to gauge some of the world's best Nebbiolo-based wines.

The flavors of raspberry and cherry fruit are delicious, but the texture is scoury and a little warm, even though the alcohol is relatively low.",86,30.0,California,Edna Valley,Pinot Noir,Baileyana
Spain,"Berry and cinnamon aromas are lightly woody and spicy. This is tannic but not mean or fierce. Flavors of oaky plum and berry fruits turn savory in front of a finish with a dry, snappy, slightly raw feel.

Spain,"Bacon, sawdust and earth along with cassis and raspberry kick start this lively, acid-driven red. The palate offers tart plum and raspberry, all steered to a point by piercing, laser-beam acidity. Oak plays a prominent role throughout, especially on the finish.

US,"Dark, full-bodied and dry, with some significant tannins. Flavor-wise, the wine veers toward blackberries, mocha and Chinese mushu plum sauce. Yet it's soft in acidity. Probably best now for vibrancy.",88,35.0,California,Mount Veeder,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Yates Family Vineyard
US,"Here's a dry, somewhat gritty Cab, with pronounced tannins framing coffee and blackberry flavors. Full-bodied, it should be nice with beef dishes.",84,22.0,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon,San Simeon
US,"It hits all the right Cabernet notes of blackberry, plum, cassis, tobacco, mint and even chocolate. Dry and well structured, with fine acidity and modulated tannins. So why not a higher score? Because everything is very light. Nonetheless, it's good value for the money.",84,10.0,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,Quail Creek
Italy,"With fruit selected from a single-vineyard site, this riserva does a nice job of portraying a fresh cherry flavor within an elaborate framework of oak spice, leather and tobacco notes. The wine is propped up by tight wood-derived tannins, which gives it a firm structure. It could use a few more years of cellar aging",91,30.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,Sangiovese,Castello di Gabbiano

France,"This is a wine that speaks of its terroir, the chalk soil coming out in a very mineral, austere character. It has elegance, class, great style of poise, showing acidity, fresh green fruits and a need to age for at least 5 years.",93,46.0,Burgundy,Chablis,Chardonnay,William Fèvre
Italy,"This bold wine from the acclaimed Bussia cru delivers meaty and masculine aromas of blackberry, smoked ham, vanilla bean, cured beef, nutmeg, clove and polished black stone.

US,"A good, lusty wine, although it's too young now, offering a big mouthful of tannins, acidity and immature fruit. A blend of 99% Cab and 1% Petit Verdot, it's a hard wine, but the flavors are immaculate, suggesting ripe blackberries and currants that veer into a touch of raisin. Give it 4–5 years in the cellar to come around.",90,70.0,California,Stags Leap District,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Shafer

US,"This is a very rich, fruity Pinot Noir, so if you like ripeness, you'll love it. Floods the mouth with cherries, raspberries and strawberries, while 50% new French oak adds even richer notes of vanilla and buttered toast. It's flamboyant now, and should be opened in the next 3–4 years.",91,35.0,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,Merryvale

US,"Another fabulous I Block from Mondavi. Exceptionally ripe in grapefruit, lime and gooseberry fruit, it shows the minerality of this vineyard that gives the wine grip and grounding.

This is not a wine to age, but will hold over the next four years.",93,75.0,California,Oakville,Fumé Blanc,Robert Mondavi
Italy,"Made from old vines and aged in small barrels, this wine is dominated by oak. Opening aromas include wood, toast and a hint of butter and apples.

It lacks fruit richness.",86,22.0,Lombardy,Lugana,Turbiana,Fraccaroli

France,"Aged in a small proportion of new wood, this is a concentrated, sophisticated wine. It derives its character from the local Braucol and Duras grapes, blended with Syrah. Together, these varieties give a complex, black berry led wine, vivid with acidity and packed with tannins. Age for 4–5 years.",91,23.0,Southwest France,Gaillac,Red Blend,Domaine Rotier
US,"Not very Oakville-like, this Cabernet is bone dry and strong in tannins, giving it an astringent mouthfeel. It's light in body for a Cabernet, with lots of acidity.

This could work as a mouthwatering apéritif or perhaps with raw shellfish.",87,12.0,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling,Arthur Metz
US,"The very tannic '05 reserve is a blend of Petit Verdot, Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc. It's fleshy and rich in blackberry, cassis and tobacco flavors, with lots of new toasty oak, and there's something meaty, like ground hamburger with a splash of tamari. Utterly delicious and very fine, this low-production bottling should evolve over many years.",93,100.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Von Strasser
US,"This is a big, gutsy, muscular Merlot marked by hard, dry tannins. That doesn't mean it's not rich.

Not going anywhere.",85,45.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Merlot,Williamson Wines
France,"The perfumes of wood mingle with sweet Malbec berry fruit aromas. The wine is in a style that initially emphasizes the fresh, juicy fruit. Then it moves in on the tannins to give a densely dry wine, finishing with a tight, mineral edge.",91,21.0,Southwest France,Cahors,Malbec,Georges Vigouroux
US,"Here's a Cab that makes a play for supremecy in a very crowded field. The wine, which contains a drop of Merlot, is solidly in the modern, international, Napa cult style. Soft and appealing for its blackberry, currant, plum and vanilla oak flavors, it's drinkable now, but such are the tannins that it will be better after 2008.",93,125.0,California,Stags Leap District,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pillar Rock

US,"This is the winery's flagship wine, the one that made it famous decades ago. It hasn't changed much over the years. It's still tannic and austere in youth, requiring many years to develop.

Best after 2010.",92,70.0,California,Stags Leap District,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clos du Val

France,"Ripe and soft, perfumed and floral, this is pure fruit, a pear- and peach-flavored wine with a hint of toast and almonds. It is clean as a mountain stream, so fresh, but with some weight.

US,"This is Paraiso's most expensive Pinot, a block selection from their estate vineyard in the southern part of the Highlands. The wine is very good, although for some reason not quite up there with the 2001 or 2003. The fruity ripeness shows in the forward cherry, raspberry and cola-root beer flavors, and and wine is fully dry. Drink now.",88,40.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir,Paraiso Vineyards
US,"The big acidity on this wine and the citrus fruit flavors make it kind of austere and minerally. But partial new oak and sur lie aging add some richness. This is a very dry, elegant, structural Chard meant for food. Try with a firm white fish topped with a fruity salsa.",87,19.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Chardonnay,Handley
France,"This bottling from Guigal's own Hermitage holdings is incredibly rich and ripe (15.5% alcohol). In fact, it comes dangerously close to being overblown before the syrupy cherry fruit is reined back in by underlying spice and minerality. Expect that minerally edge to assert itself more with time in the cellar, making this a wine worth revisiting in 10 years' time.",94,450.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,Syrah,E. Guigal
US,"This limited release (300 cases), first-ever Zin from Columbia Crest points to the rising prominence of this quintessentially Californian grape. In Washington's Wahluke Slope, Zin ripens well without turning into a Port-like substance.

It's a balanced mix of berry, barrel and crisp, palate-cleansing acid.",88,30.0,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Zinfandel,Columbia Crest
Argentina,"Cheese and crackers on the nose, meaning it's not all that fruity and clean. In the mouth, it's also bisquits and cheddar city.

One can only say this bubbly has its issues.",82,30.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Champagne Blend,Valentin Bianchi
Spain,"Bold, dark and handsome, albeit a touch herbal and earthy on the nose. The palate is thick and statuesque, with herbal, rooty berry fruit, a spot of raisin, and cracked black pepper.

US,"Fermented to a plus-size 15.4% alcohol, this rare wine from one of Washington's oldest and best Cabernet vineyards shows what a gifted winemaker can do with great fruit. The play of flavors, mixing red and purple fruits, toasted nuts, mocha, caramel, bark and earth, is exceptional. The detail is extraordinary for a wine with such high alcohol. The acids and tannins are seamless and fine, and the flavors extend into an unusual finish that suggests menthol and eucalyptus – not generally a character found in Champoux fruit. All in all it's a wonderful voyage, and one of a handful of essential Washington wines.",95,72.0,Oregon,Columbia Valley (OR),Cabernet Sauvignon,Sineann
Italy,"Bellenda is an innovative and hardworking winery that is not afraid to go against the grain.

Spain,"Here's yet another impressive Garnacha-based wine from the traveling Scotsman Norrel Robertson. There's a black-fruit component that's aided by dried oregano, thyme and briar.

The best wine in Robertson's portfolio.",91,21.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,Red Blend,Papa Luna

US,"A superfine Zin, lush, fruity and balanced, and with extra richness and finesse. Really shows off its ripe blackberries, cherries and mocha, in a dry package with smooth tannins.",91,22.0,California,Napa Valley,Zinfandel,Calistoga Cellars
France,"Deliciously ripe fruit, giving softness and power at the same time. The wine has rich strawberry and black plum fruits along with red currant freshness. At the same time, it has a complex structure of firm tannins, spice and wood. The end is more generous, opulent.",91,83.0,Burgundy,Beaune,Pinot Noir,Domaine de la Vougeraie
Italy,"Compared to the 2006 vintage of this same wine, this expression offers a greener personality with bright aromas of cut grass and herbs over loads of dark fruit and exotic spice. There's a soft, sweet and chewy quality to the wine's thick texture.",88,40.0,Veneto,Valpolicella Classico Superiore,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Tedeschi
US,"Soft, dry and satisfying, this is a gentle Cabernet for everyday drinking. It has pleasant flavors of blackberries, currants, cedar and spices.",84,13.0,California,Alexander Valley,Meritage,Cameron Hughes
US,"Cherry pie aromas kick off the nose of this bottling from a steep hilllside site behind Cambria. Clove, nutmeg and maple-cured bacon notes follow. Blackberry, vanilla and clove flavors glide on the palate, which offers ample tannins and acidity for cellaring, although the wine is delicious now.",93,46.0,California,San Luis Obispo County,Pinot Noir,Stolo
Australia,"This is a hugely fruity, lush wine destined for early consumption. The blend of 65% Shiraz and 35% Grenache displays almost grapey aromas and flavors, a bit of cassis and plushly textured tannins. Drink now as a cocktail red or with casual fare.",90,20.0,South Australia,South Australia,Shiraz-Grenache,Kilikanoon

Here, you'll find ripe, spicy raspberry and cherry, brightened by crisp coastal acidity and enhanced by a touch of smoky oak. Drink it now.",90,50.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
US,"A welcome addition to the Bunchgrass lineup, this white Bordeaux-style blend is one third barrel-fermented Semillon, two thirds tank-fermented Sauvignon Blanc. The ripe and textural fruit still shows a lightly yeasty character, along with highlights of honey graham cracker.",90,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style White Blend,Bunchgrass
US,"Another Fenestra-Silvaspoons collaboration, Tourvanillo is a proprietary blend of Iberian grapes, predominantly Touriga, and is marked mostly by its aromatic highlights of spicy cinnamon and vibrant currant. Dense, it is interesting and intense with rounded edges and a leathery, long finish.",88,28.0,California,Lodi,Red Blend,Fenestra
Spain,"Leathery olive aromas are not overly ripe or fruity. This is Graciano, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon from southerly Cádiz, and it's tight and narrow in mouthfeel, with roasted, stalky berry flavors. A full, grabby finish tastes more savory and spicy than fruity.",88,19.0,Andalucia,Vino de la Tierra de Cádiz,Red Blend,Huerta de Albalá
Spain,"Earthy berry scents and charred aromas of grilled steak include notes of wood spice and vanilla. On the palate, this is deep, and shows a good mix of bright acidity and meaty depth. Flavors of toasty oak, chocolate, blackberry and pepper finish with persistent chocolaty notes and intense acidity. Drink through 2028.",92,46.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Tempranillo,Aventino
US,"This smooth wine has good balance, and a fairly full mouthfeel. Even on the palate, it shows a bit of both ends of the Sauvignon Blanc spectrum—the crisp grassy, herb and grapefruit side and also fig, pear and melon as foundation.",86,16.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Rancho Zabaco
France,"A densely tannic wine that is showing fine aging potential. It is well endowed with weight, acidity and ripe black currant fruits. With the rich fruit that opens slowly in the mouth, it has a fine combination of sweetness and structure. Age for 5–6 years.",91,80.0,Bordeaux,Margaux,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Haut Breton Larigaudière

The palate delivers a bit of salinity with more cranberry fruit as well as graphite, with a sour, grippy finish.",89,40.0,California,Paso Robles,Pinot Noir,Adelaida
France,"Floral and mineral, this wine has white currant flavors, herbs and green vegetables. It's full of flavor, ripe and concentrated, with great waves of fruit. The aftertaste is dry, but there's also a hint of honey.",87,30.0,Loire Valley,Montlouis-sur-Loire,Chenin Blanc,Domaine les Loges de la Folie
Italy,"Here is a subtle, delicate style that emphasizes cherry cola, apple, root beer, nutty-green aromas such as dried chopped herbs or tea leaf, with currant berry and dried prunes. The fruit tastes very ripe in the mouth and this sensation is underlined by the wine's natural succulence and chewy consistency.",90,40.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Corteforte
France,"Poised between a rich, soft Pinot Noir and one with structure, this wine from a lesser-known premier cru is delicious. The fruits are restrained, but there is exuberance from the acidity, the fine tannins and the jammy finish. A wine that is evolving already, but will also age well.",92,75.0,Burgundy,Beaune,Pinot Noir,Albert Morot
Italy,"Vigneto Brich Ronchi opens with bright and plump fruit tones that recall black currant, cherry and cassis followed by elegant tones of smoke, leather and tobacco. The wine is intense and powerful with a soft, velvety texture backed by structured tannins that give it backbone and staying power. Very nice. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.",93,24.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Nebbiolo,Albino Rocca
France,"Lifted hints of chamomile and apple peel rise straight from the glass. The palate has the same streamlined citrus focus and just homes in on that sleek dry apple freshness that seem to be a dynamic force at the center of this wine. The flavors are concentrated and totally dominated by utter lemon freshness, tart and vivid to the last. Lovely now but with further potential. Drink now through 2030.",93,50.0,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling,Cave de Turckheim
US,"This is a standard, everyday Zinfandel that's rugged and needs meats and cheeses to tame it. It's rough in tannins and dry, with a strange acidity accompanying ripe to overripe flavors of blackberries, currants and pepper.",83,40.0,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel,Oso Libre
Spain,"Rubbery cherry and berry aromas feed into a forward, chewy palate with raw, spicy flavors of plum offset by oaky vanilla and some bitterness. A fresh, angular finish is braced by snappy acidity.",88,23.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo,Luis Cañas
US,"Give this young Zin some time in the bottle. It's too jammy and thick to show its best now. With a rich core of blackberries, chocolate, leather, plums and spices that are wrapped into significant tannins, it should meld together by the middle of 2010.",88,40.0,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel,Ledson
Australia,"Briar and moist clay aromas lead to tannins that feel grabby at first, then smooth out with air. Aeration is key, too, in allowing flavors of blackberry and blueberry to emerge. Nice now, and probably better after another year in bottle. Imported by Scott Street Portfolio.",89,22.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,Cabernet Sauvignon,Tapestry
US,"Super-peppery, this full-bodied Zin also has grilled blackberry and plum, mocha, licorice, beef jerky and gingersnap cookie flavors. The rich tannins call for grilled steaks and chops.",87,36.0,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel,Peachy Canyon
US,"This fine wine shows how well the variety grows in Napa Valley. The tannins are lovely and refined, acidity is perfect, the finish is dry, the alcohol isn't too high, and the fruit flavors are ripe and accessible. That resolves most of the problems that plague Petite Sirah. Should develop bottle complexities over the next several years.",88,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Petite Sirah,R & B Cellars
US,"Testarossa has an incredible track record with Bien Nacido Pinot Noir, and in 2007, they've produced as fine a wine as they've ever done. It's dry, crisp, silky and just wonderful in the mouth, with rewarding flavors of cherries, currants, cola, licorice, sautéed wild mushrooms, balsamic and pepper. Terrific and complex now, and should slowly age for at least sic years.",94,56.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Noir,Testarossa
France,"With its touch of toast and full green and white fruits, this is a delicious wine edged with a mineral texture. It is ripe and looking to age for another 2–3 years.",91,24.0,Burgundy,Chablis,Chardonnay,Domaine Christian Moreau Père et Fils
Italy,"Here's an exciting dessert wine that opens with an intense fragrance of mint, thyme and berry.

The rich flavors are brightened by fresh acidity that leaves a clean rather than cloying finish.",92,50.0,Central Italy,Umbria,Aleatico,Barberani

US,"Crisp and on the sweet side, this PG has flavors of honey, lemons, limes, green apples, figs and peppery spices. Nice as a cocktail sipper. Try with Chinese food for something different.",85,14.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Gris,Balletto
US,"At the age of nearly four years, this Cabernet remains a bit ungainly. Although it has some very pretty, polished mountain tannins, it tastes somewhat sweet and extracted in jammy blackberries and black cherries, with a mocha and vanilla richness reminiscent of a Starbucks drink. Could develop with time.",86,100.0,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cornerstone
US,"This powerfully flavored Chardonnay is laserlike in the intensity of its fruit. Mangoes, pineapples and lemon custard assault the palate, wrapped in a creamy smooth texture. Not particularly subtle, and not for the faint-hearted, this is a quintessentially ripe California wine.",87,18.0,California,Mendocino,Chardonnay,Ceago Vinegarden
US,"This is the first dry Riesling since 1993, though it was a Ponzi hallmark from 1974 until it was dropped. Fashions have brought dry Riesling into play again, and this is a textbook example mixing Meyer lemon, chamomile tea and even a bit of peppery spice. Unfortunately just 70 cases were made.",92,25.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling,Ponzi
US,"Extraordinarily ripe and sweet in blackberries, cassis and figs, with a lovely perfume of violets and cedar, this soft, lush Cabernet, which was blended with some Petit Verdot, is so decadent now, you can hardly resist it. But it's pretty tannic, with good acidity, and has the structure to ride out the next eight years.",94,95.0,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon,Round Pond
Spain,"The bouquet seems nutty and salinic, and overall this extra dry (meaning fairly sweet) focuses on soft and sugary mango and melon flavors. It's not as lively as it needs to be to balance the sweetness, so ultimately the wine comes up a touch flat. Imported by Freixenet USA.",84,12.0,Catalonia,Cava,Sparkling Blend,Segura Viudas
US,"Kevin Riley packs eight varieties into this pink wine, but the major proportion of Syrah and Grenache lend it its deep hue and rose petal, red cherry and vanilla notes on the nose. Grippy red plum skin flavors dominate the compellingly tense palate, followed by Rainier cherry and orange rind touches.",89,42.0,California,Paso Robles,Rosé,Proulx
France,"83-85 Barrel sample. Juicy, over-extracted with flavors of beetroot. Difficult to discern any future.",84,24.0,Bordeaux,Pomerol,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château la Clémence
US,"A very nice Cab that's praiseworthy for its dryness, balance and elegance. It's not as rich and dense as some more expensive wines, but offers good berry, cherry and sage flavors, with a scour of tannins.",86,10.0,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,Ironstone
France,"This is a finely balanced, if still very structured wine. It has powerful tannins, but also rich, black, juicy fruits that are coming into integration. Solid and concentrated, the wine has great potential and needs to age for at least four years.",90,15.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Rauzan Despagne
Italy,This is an easy blend of Inzolia and Chardonnay (with a small component that is aged in oak) with a fresh fruity and floral approach. The oak element is all but invisible save for a touch of extra smoothness in terms of texture.,86,15.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,White Blend,Di Prima
France,"Produced from a parcel of old vines, this wood-aged wine has spice as well as white fruits and a touch of honey. It's a generous wine with its toast, almonds and rounded texture. The lightest touch of minerality gives structure and the potential to age. Drink now and until 2020.",90,40.0,Loire Valley,Vouvray,Chenin Blanc,Domaine Vincent Carême
Italy,"Leafy underbrush, espresso, baked plum, menthol and toast aromas slowly emerge. The straightforward palate offers ripe Morello cherry, star anise and chopped herb while assertive tannins clench the abrupt finish. Give the tannins some time to unfurl then drink up.",87,58.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese,Il Grappolo
US,"Shows lots of acidity and also the firm tannins and tug of dried herbs that always accompany this bottling. Quite good, with fruity flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants and cola, but feels a little rustic. Could harmonize over the next 6–8 years.",92,56.0,California,Yorkville Highlands,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"This tart and aromatic white blend could be labeled Chardonnay; less than a quarter is a mix of Riesling, Muscat, Gewürztraminer and Pinot Gris. It's detailed and lively, with bright citrus, pineapple, pink grapefruit and sweet spice.",88,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),White Blend,Magnificent Wine Company
US,"Baked red cherry, rose petal, star anise and cinnamon sauce show on the spice-laced nose of this bottling from Rhône grape specialist Jaffurs. More cherry and deep raspberry flavors pop on the palate, meeting with lilac and violet notes, all polished by more cinnamon spice.",92,34.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Grenache,Jaffurs
Italy,"Fresh and refined, this delightful, easy-drinking wine opens with scents of rose, woodland berry and a whiff of dark cooking spice. The vibrant, savory palate offers juicy red cherry, raspberry and white pepper alongside bright acidity and polished tannins. Drink through 2018.",90,25.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Alba,Barbera,Cascina delle Rose

Argentina,"Green, grassy and not very appealing. There's a can't-miss murky, green, herbal character here that yields almost weedy fruit flavors and carob. Sweet, candied, green and just not that good for a Paul Hobbs-made wine.",81,19.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Merlot,Viña Cobos
Argentina,"More baked, muddled and heavy than Alicia's Paso de Piedra bottling, with roasted plum/berry flavors and a heavy, forceful palate that carries some burn, heat and rubber. Big and bullish, like a proverbial toro in a china shop. A lot of oak, too.",87,27.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Malbec,Viña Alicia
US,"This is a strong, oaky Chardonnay. It's crisp in acidity and forward in pineapple jam, lemon custard and vanilla meringue flavors. If you like the ripe, California style, it's for you.",88,23.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay,Manzoni
Spain,"Light cherry and mild sulfuric aromas are standard fare for this class of wine, while the palate is snappy and fresh, with sweet-and-sour cherry and strawberry flavors. Finishes a little gritty and candied, but pleasant enough overall.",84,8.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,Red Blend,Don Ramón
Italy,"Displaying a ripe, multifaceted nose with violets, cumin, licorice, tar and chocolate elements, this wine shows class and grace with classic dry cherry flavors.  Possessing lovely weight and balance, it is full without being heavy, and finishes with dusty rose and even tannins.",89,40.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Marchesi di Barolo
Italy,"This is a beautiful sparkling wine with well-integrated aromas of citrus, stone fruit and toasted bread. The wine is luminous and soft with foamy perlage and elegant smoothness in the mouth. Its fruit flavors endure many long minutes.",90,24.0,Lombardy,Franciacorta,Sparkling Blend,Bellavista
US,"Nice and smooth for this sometimes boring variety, with a lush texture and appealingly dry flavors of blackberries, violets, mocha and coconut macaroon cookie, and an almond skin bitterness in the finish. The tannins are there, rich and sturdy, offering a firm counterbalance to the ripeness.",90,25.0,California,Paso Robles,Barbera,Christian Lazo
France,"A flat wine, missing the verve and liveliness of Muscadet. It's  soft, with simple apple and grapefruit flavors. The taut finish is the best reminder of the style.",84,11.0,Loire Valley,Muscadet Sèvre et Maine,Melon,Remy-Pannier
US,"This has interesting spice in both the nose and the mouth, a bit like sniffing fresh pine needles. There is also a whiff of rose petal and a streak of those floral flavors in the back of the palate. Just under 13% alcohol, this pretty white wine would pair up nicely with a delicate seafood dish.",86,12.0,Washington,Puget Sound,Angevine,Mount Baker
US,"Light, pale, tart, with generic, simple red berry flavors.",82,23.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Sangiovese,San Juan Vineyards
US,"What happened? This wine went from a dense and powerful 2004 version to this thin, woody and green effort. It is hard to believe that something major has not changed—vineyard sources or rows? In any event, despite its dark color, the wine has no weight; it's just a thin, generic red.",83,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Syrah,Woodinville Wine Cellars
Italy,"Shows poise and balance in its nicely melded herb, licorice, cherry and bitter-chocolate elements. There's good texture on the palate and some complexity on the finish, where a mineral note accents the dry cherry and tea flavors.",89,9.0,Tuscany,Chianti Colli Senesi,Sangiovese,Baroncini
Spain,"Sweet and candied on the nose, which  draws you in. Runs a touch chunky, with plum and licorice flavors. Good acidity creates a racy mouthfeel, even teetering on fiery. Tight on the finish, but crisp and fresh. The blend is 80% Cabernet and the rest Merlot.",88,24.0,Northern Spain,Somontano,Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot,Enate
US,"A single-clone selection from this vineyard; it's like a pencil drawing, a sketch for a complete wine. Sharp edges, tight lines, a quick burst of pomegranate, earthy tannins and it stops, a hard finish.",87,50.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Pinot Noir,Erath
Italy,"Here's a vintage Extra Dry Prosecco (most producers omit the vintage date, with the exception of wines such as this, marked “Millesimato”), with many layers of sweet aromas that resemble peachy fruit, white flowers and honey.",87,18.0,Veneto,Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco Superiore,Glera,Il Follo

US,"Another classic wine from this fine Napa producer, and one that will live for a long time in your cellar. It is young and tight now, but through the tannins and acids the palate detects gobs of lush, ripe blackcurrants and plums, herbs and tobacco. The tannins are a wonder—rich, thick and intricate, and fully ripe. As good as it is now, this lovely wine will get better through 2009.",94,95.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clos du Val
US,"A Russian River interpretation of a Rhône blend, this is made from Viognier, Marsanne and Roussanne. It's dry and marked by zesty acidity and just a hint of oak. The pineapple, lime, pear, peach and white pepper flavors are rich. This is a genuinely food-friendly wine.",89,25.0,California,Russian River Valley,Rhône-style White Blend,Montemaggiore

US,"This blockbuster, powerhouse of a wine suggests blueberry pie and chocolate as it opens in the glass. On the palate, it's smooth and seductively silky, offering complex cedar, peppercorn and peppery oak seasonings amidst its dense richness. It finishes with finesse and spice.",95,325.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hall

France,"Undoubtedly an ambitious effort, Albrecht's Amplus is an impressively extracted Pinot that ends up coming across as too woody and too tannic for its modest cherry fruit. Lots of vanilla, cedar and caramel if you like that sort of thing.",84,44.0,Alsace,Alsace,Pinot Noir,Lucien Albrecht
US,"This is a very big, full-bodied Pinot Noir that's not particularly delicate or elegant in youth. It could almost be a Grenache, it's so dense, with cherry, cola, anise, pepper and oak flavors. Yet it's bone dry, and has everything it needs for the cellar. Give it until 2012.",88,58.0,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Pinot Noir,Talley

US,"The label points out that this is barrel fermented, but a sniff and sip will tell you that much. The nose pumps petrol at first and then plenty of smoky wood. In the mouth, it's immensely round and chewy, with vanilla, coconut, banana and peach flavors. Broad but zesty enough, which allows the heavy toast element to work.",87,20.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Moon Mountain Vineyard

Australia,"With such abyss-deep black aromas (steak, pepper, licorice) the palate, by not knocking you out with giant tannins and lots of charred oak, feels slender in comparison. This is a pleasing balance of smooth tannins, and pretty black plum and blueberry flavors.",87,40.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Limb
France,"Initially, the wine appears soft, with a noticeable layer of wood. The yellow fruit comes slowly through the spice, adding fruit richness. At the end, a burst of refreshing acidity finishes the wine with a lift. Worth aging for 2–3 years. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",90,38.0,Burgundy,Chablis,Chardonnay,Joseph Drouhin

Barrel notes of coffee and cinnamon are expressive and beautifully integrated.",92,36.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Vista Hills

The fine tannins and overall balance proceed through a lingering finish that carries a pleasing suggestion of well-tanned leather.",93,55.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,King Estate
US,"The oak in this wine is restrained, partly because it aged in stainless steel and a sizable percentage of neutral oak. Still, a richness of apple and pear compote provide a steady level of richness, while a lemon squeeze of acidity keeps it fresh and youthful.",90,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay,Stags' Leap Winery
Spain,"Hailing from the very hot 2003 vintage, this wine is baked and full, with mature yet rich aromas.

Drink now.",89,45.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo,Puelles
US,"Smells and tastes over-oaked, and turns very tannic and hard in the mouth, relieved by simple blackberry and cherry jam flavors. This astringent wine doesn't seem likely to improve with age.",82,15.0,California,Lodi,Petite Sirah,Christine Andrew
Australia,"Bright and limey, with butterscotch notes punctuating the citrus fruit. The crisp palate is light-to-medium- bodied and winds up on a fleeting mineral note. Try with halibut. Best now to 2011.",85,19.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,Chardonnay,Vasse Felix

US,"This is not the same wine as Niebaum-Coppola's Cask Cabernet, although it sells for the same price. It's made in a different style, more tannic and not as apparently oaky. To judge from the depth of flavor, it's extremely cellarworthy. Should unfold by 2008 and develop for years beyond.",90,65.0,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rubicon Estate
US,"Silverado's estate 2003 Cab is a worthy followup to their '02. So classy, only Napa makes Cabs this balanced, rich and ageworthy, and this one from Stags Leap defines Tchelistcheff's description of an iron fist in a velvet glove. Great now, although young, and will age effortlessly for at least 10 years, probably longer.",93,75.0,California,Stags Leap District,Cabernet Sauvignon,Silverado
Argentina,"Compared to the 2004, this wine seems less generous. The nose is solid, with licorice, spice, pepper and plum fruit.

Italy,"Fontanafredda's Moscato d'Asti is a cut above its competitors, with intense orange, grape and pear aromas that lead into a palate of white grapes and ground cherries.

Italy,"The Le Vigne cru from Luciano Sandrone delivers focused aromas of wild cherries, white almond, cola and light shadings of sweet spice.

Pair this delicious wine with lamb, pork or beef.",94,155.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Luciano Sandrone
Spain,"Black licorice, mint and a hint of raisin work the nose. However, the palate on this venerable Ribera wine is a bit jumpy and early on it seems tart and miserly; the upside is that the wine will age for 15 years. To drink now it'll need to go with food. If given plenty of airing or decanting it'll show its best.",88,38.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Tempranillo Blend,Pesquera
US,"This has been 10% barrel fermented and aged for about two months. There's a hint of barrel toast but it's very light; the varietal character is nicely displayed. Crisp acidity and a strong citrus mix of orange blossom and lemon rind flavors define the midpalate, leading into pineapple and grapefruit as it winds through the finish. Nice bottle!",88,19.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier,Whitman Cellars
France,"Restrained in style, with modest pear and honey notes tinged with a toasty, mealy edge. Shows some nice creaminess to the midpalate, then fades gradually on the finish. Drink now.",85,52.0,Rhône Valley,Châteauneuf-du-Pape,Rhône-style White Blend,Paul Jaboulet Aîné

US,"Like its companion '01 Merlot release, this Cab needs time to come together, but when that happens, it will be a lovely drink. The firm, chunky tannins will hold the black currant and herb flavors through this decade.",90,28.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Clos du Val
US,"Very dry, with mouth-watering acidity, but the palate also searches for a little more fruit than the wine offers. Still, the pineapples, peaches and apricots are pleasant enough.",88,33.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Chardonnay,Kunde
Spain,"This wine proves that “organic” doesn't automatically translate into great. The nose is leathery and sweet, with red licorice and peanut aromas.

France,"The origins of this estate go back to the 13th century when it was the property of the Knights Templar.

US,"Rose petals, red currants, red licorice and a bit of snapped sage stick entertain the nose on this bottling, which can be sampled at the producer's downtown Paso tasting room.

US,"Not such a rarity these days, Albariño is turning heads in California and Oregon. This tart, juicy, and deliciously fresh effort is loaded with tangy citrus and green apple fruit.

US,"From the very fine 2007 vintage comes this surprisingly tannic Cabernet. Even at the age of more than four years, it's still tough and astringent.

Made from the valley's coolest, foggiest “deep end,” it's extraordinarily rich, with explosive flavors of black and red currants, cola, mocha, licorice and cedar. Black Kite has really turned into a Pinot producer to watch. Drink now through 2012.",94,42.0,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Noir,Black Kite

France,"As rich and opulent as its red wine pair, this is ripe and soft, a swirl of velvet tempered by citrus and sweet and fresh acidity. The toast of the wood is only just evident, its presence felt as much as tasted. Despite its richness, it does remain wedded to Burgundy, as evidenced by the tight, steely finish. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",92,102.0,Burgundy,Beaune,Chardonnay,Joseph Drouhin

France,"From vineyards close to the Gironde estuary, this estate has produced a bright and fruity wine dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon.

France,"As in many 2009s from the Northern Rhône, the Syrah fruit is superripe. Add in aging in 100% new oak barrels and the result is a big, richly tannic wine redolent of vanilla, cedar and blackberries. Drink now–2025.",91,50.0,Rhône Valley,Cornas,Syrah,Cave de Tain

Hard to imagine anyone not liking it a lot.",91,42.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Vision Cellars

France,"Subtle but luscious notes of Mirabelle plum, ripe greengage and peach lend a seductive touch to this taut, structured and beautifully textured wine whose palate is reminiscent of bot fresh apple peel and grapefruit zest. Covers of fruit are tautly spread across spokes of acidity, creating a wonderful tension that keeps you wanting more.

Great now and for a decade.",93,38.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Joseph Swan Vineyards

US,"This is an extraordinarily rich and rewarding Cabernet to drink now. Drenched in all new French oak, it's elaborate in spicy, charred wood and vanillins, but the underlying wine easily supports that weight. It's flamboyant in blackberries, cherries, chocolate, red licorice and cola. The alcohol seems high, but that's in the modern style, and there's no denying the sheer lusciousness.",96,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Carter

US,"Lots of zesty, mouthwatering acidity in this Chardonnay. The pineapple, crème brûlée, buttered toast and vanilla flavors are so rich that they require balance, which the zippy acidity provides. Maybe a touch too oaky, but that's a matter of personal preference.",89,30.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay,JCB

US,"This Syrah is considerably lighter in body than you'd expect for a variety that's often heavy and full bodied.

The flavors are endless and complex, richness combining with the lively character of the vintage. Age for many years.",98,757.0,Burgundy,Montrachet,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père & Fils
US,"The nose seems lean and vaguely unripe. You get aromas of chocolate and green olives, and the most distant whiff of meat. Of course there's a great deal of oak, including American, which lends vanillin and smoky notes, but still an impression of leanness carries through in the mouth. It struggles to say the word “fruit.” It's also very tannic. That aside, it may soften and improve in time.",85,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Merlot,Newlan
Italy,"This Sangiovese-Canaiolo blend has loads of sweet spice on the nose. There's so much spice, in fact, it's not easy to locate its natural core of red fruit.

US,"You can't smell acidity, but you can smell fruit so bright, it has to be high in acidity.

US,"You should give this some time in the cellar, because right now, it's all about juicy primary raspberry and cherry fruit and sweet, smoky oak. Nothing's come together.

US,"Out of the ordinary, with intense aromas of petrol, smoke, roasted corn and musky citrus. In many ways it does not seem Californian in that it isn't a pure, polished wine.

US,"This is the first Stags Leap wine I've ever had from Martin Ray, who's been making Cabs from many other appellations for years. It's also one of the best Cabs the winery has ever produced.

France,"Lifted cracked pepper and cherry scents on the nose are rounded a bit on the palate by hints of caramelly oak, but this is still a good representation of northern Rhône Syrah, finishing dry and peppery.",87,25.0,Rhône Valley,Saint-Joseph,Rhône-style Red Blend,Brotte
Spain,"Lightly spiced up front, with dry wood aromas, light cherry and floral hints. Feels juicy and tight, with basic red-plum flavors that transition quickly to spice and acidic crispness on a short finish.",87,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo,Bodegas Zugober
US,"With a deep golden color, this late-harvest Riesling has rich flavors of apricots and pears. It's a little on the soft side, lacking the crispness to give balance to the sweetness. Drink now.",86,25.0,California,Monterey County,Riesling,Kendall-Jackson
Italy,There's added aromatic dimension here thanks to the layer of cut grass and fresh herb that frames the wine's sweet perfumes. Pair this dessert sparkler with fresh fruit or ice cream cake.,87,19.0,Piedmont,Moscato d'Asti,Moscato,Ghione
US,"This Sauvignon Blanc impresses for subtle elegance. It's not the biggest or the fruitiest, doesn't dazzle with richness, and doesn't club you over the head with oak. Instead, it offers dryness, crisp acidity and tart green apple, lemongrass, cream and vanilla flavors.",91,40.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Rochioli
Italy,"A charming package, with raspberries and fresh plums as an opening act followed by leather and mushrooms on the palate and just a hint of tannin. The finish falls a bit short but offers up an intriguing watermelon note. Drink up.",87,18.0,Piedmont,Dolcetto d'Alba,Dolcetto,Marchesi di Barolo
US,"High alcohol gives this dry, tannic wine some heat, and the overripe fruit lends a raisiny, pruny tinge to the blackberry flavor.",85,35.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Zinfandel,Brazin
US,"This excellent boutique brand is slowly expanding, doubling the production of the estate wine in 2014, and adding two new vineyards to the mix in 2016. Consistent from vintage to vintage is the elegance and depth of detail, beginning with subtle, entwined fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry. Hints of dried herb, cigar box, and a touch of chocolate come up through the finish. The tannins are proportionate, though still a bit astringent, suggesting a few more years of bottle age would be beneficial.",92,45.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Pinot Noir,Élevée Winegrowers
Australia,"Made in a rather lean, racy style, the big question for this wine is whether it will soften and flesh out over the next five years or so. Right now, it's tight and citrusy, with a stony hardness that lacks much charm but would suit raw oysters just fine.",86,16.0,South Australia,Eden Valley,Riesling,St Hallett
France,"With a sense of tannic structure and a dry background, this is a firm wine. It has some weight, although the texture and the black currant fruits are light and stylish rather than dense. Drink from 2016.",85,13.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château les Ancres
US,"Give this one some time to breathe, as it's a bit tight on opening. With a relatively modest 13.5% alcohol, it's not as ripe as some Napa Cabs, and it's also fairly tannic. There's an astringent, tea-like edge to the cassis and cherries. Finely structured and bone dry, this Cab should develop well over the next eight years.",90,50.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Trinchero
Italy,"Although this is a young Barbera—from the 2008 vintage—the wine already shows signs of aging. The color is ruby bordering on garnet and the nose is characterized by mature berry, wet earth, bramble and a touch of black truffle.",87,24.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,Barbera,F.lli Trinchero
US,"Pear, pineapple and citrus aromas with spearmint accents comprise the bouquet of this Russian River favorite. The wine is round and soft with tea, lemon, tropical fruit and buttercream flavors. It's light- to medium- weight, but with enough complexity to hold the taster's interest, and a persistent, tangy, sweet and sour back-end fade.",89,30.0,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay,De Loach
France,"Ripe and perfumed, this is packed with the richness of 2010 along with its structure. It has weight, juicy black and red berry fruits and a tense structure that still needs time. Acidity at the end provides a fresh lift to the essentially firm wine.",87,13.0,Bordeaux,Côtes de Bourg,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Maine d'Arman
Italy,"Chocolate, cinnamon and plum aromas, a richly textured palate and a lovely fruit-acid balance are all in play. Mint, dried spice and leather notes accent the rich, plummy fruit. Well-dispersed tannins, tart plum and cocoa flavors characterize the long finish. Drinks well now; will improve through 2004.",90,36.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,Sangiovese,Castello di Meleto
US,"Winemaker Keith Emerson is the Director of Winemaking for Vineyard 29, a Napa-based winery and custom-crush facility. This debut wine from his own label is flat-out lovely. A core of focused cherry fruit is surrounded with accent flavors that circle like moons around a central planet. Tart acids, sweet toast, dark chocolate and a whisp of smoke, all almost ethereal and finely crafted.",93,60.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Sonría
US,"If you know those Argentine Malbecs, you know what you're in for. This is a dark, huge, tannic, explosive red wine, with massive blackberry and cherry, cocoa and sweet leather flavors. It's perfectly dry, but quite a bit softer than those from Argentina. Drink now with barbecued steak.",90,25.0,California,Alexander Valley,Malbec,Mosaic
US,"The vineyard, long a source for Beringer's Cabs, is in the north-central valley, east of the Silverado Trail, just below Howell Mountain. It shows the hard, tough tannins of Cabs from that neck of the woods. Flavors of red currants, cherries and cocoa are rich and vibrant, but the wine is too astringent to open now. Hold until after 2010, and it should develop for an additional 6–8 years.",92,90.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Beringer
France,"A perennial value, this year's edition boasts plenty of smoky blackberry aromas tinged with slight game notes. Medium-bodied—verging on full—there's loads of fruit and flavor packed into an easily accessible format. Ready to enjoy now and should continue to drink well for a few more years.",89,8.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Minervois,Syrah,Domaine Borie de Maurel
US,"Tight, bright and spicy, with light peach flavors under fresh herb. There's a slight and interesting taste of fennel that lingers in the back of the palate. Though under 12% alcohol, this does not come across as sweet, but rather as a racy, food-friendly and distinctive effort.",88,8.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),White Riesling,Barnard Griffin
Spain,"Sweet, plummy and unrefined on both the nose and palate. This is nothing more than simple juice that isn't terrible. It's grapey, sweet and tart, with an edgy bit of tang to the finish. Regular at best; subpar if you're being critical.",83,9.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,Tempranillo,Bodegas Fariña
US,"The vintage was very hot, and you can taste the blistering sun in the soft, melted cherry and blackberry jam flavors that stop just short of raisins. Still, high alcohol gives it a cooked, Porty aftertaste.",84,25.0,California,Fiddletown,Zinfandel,Renwood
Italy,"Light, focused and elegant, this luminous Prosecco offers simple but genuine aromas of citrus, peach and passion fruit. There's a playful touch of sweetness on the creamy, bubbly close.",86,24.0,Veneto,Prosecco,Glera,Foss Marai
France,"It is the 20% Gros Manseng in the blend that makes this wine. It gives it an extra dimension, a touch of honey and hints of apricots. It is an attractive contrast to the herbal character from the Colombard and Ugni Blanc. This a delicious wine, still young and ready to go from the end of 2017.",89,14.0,Southwest France,Côtes de Gascogne,White Blend,Domaine de Joÿ
Italy,"Villa Pillo delivers a thick and chunky Syrah from Tuscany that would pair nicely with meat roasts or sausage stuffed with fennel seeds. The wine is thick and smooth in the mouth with cherry and toasted aromas. It's not particularly complex, but it is extremely satisfying to drink.",87,24.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Syrah,Villa Pillo
Italy,"Blueberry, blackberry and cherry candy are backed by deep and penetrating notes of ash, pencil lead, mineral and licorice. The wine delivers vigor and personality and is a fine example of a Campania red with a solid structure and lasting finish.",88,18.0,Southern Italy,Campania,Aglianico,Feudi di San Gregorio
Spain,"Gritty earthy aromas come up short on freshness and clarity. This feels raw and pinching, with dry rubbing tannins. Gritty peppery berry flavors are oaky, while this finishes with savory berry, herb and tobacco flavors. Hammering tannins suggest decanting and/or service with hearty foods.",89,50.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Tempranillo,Salcis
Spain,"Green melon and lettuce aromas are fresh and clean. The wine feels solid and good, and there's a jumble of baked apple and melon flavors. Yeasty on the finish, it's made entirely from Macabeo grapes.",85,9.0,Catalonia,Cava,Sparkling Blend,Idilicum
US,"Disconnected in its youth, with separate oak and fruit elements that need time to find each other and marry. The oak shows up as caramel and butterscotch, while the fruit stands aloof, in blackberry and black currant superiority. Seems to have the inherent balance for aging. Try after 2013.",93,95.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Barnett
US,"Here's a Pinot that's so beautiful and beguiling, it's perfect to drink right away. Feels delicate and silky, with lush flavors of cherries, cotton candy, bacon, sassafras, orange peel and dusty Asian spices.",92,48.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir,Sojourn
Italy,"Despite the deep crimson color, the nose is surprisingly delicate; showing strawberries and red cherry. Pleasant, easy drinking and well balanced, but not particularly concentrated, this is a wine that will work easily with a wide variety of food without drawing much attention to itself.",85,10.0,Piedmont,Dolcetto d'Alba,Dolcetto,Neirano
US,"A strongly flavored Cabernet, powerful in blackberry, currant and cedar flavors, that impresses for sheer volume, although it is drinkable now with a brief decant. It's a bit rude now, but could calm down and develop some bottle sophistication in a few years.",88,25.0,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Geyser Peak
US,"Dusty. Chinese black tea, blackstrap molasses, anise, allspice. Tons of spice rub, Chinese 5 spice, a hint of cherry. Mouth: Fruity sweetness that quickly recedes behind a wall of tannins. Spicy. Dried cherry, sour cherry candy. Rich, big, intricate, nuanced. Now - 2010.",91,24.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Rochioli
US,"Showing ripe cherry, cola and spice flavors, this pleasant Merlot has a nice touch of smoky oak. It's dry and softly tannic, although there's a brisk backbone of acidity. Drink now.",86,25.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Merlot,Keating
France,"Elegant and smooth, perhaps with an edge of too much smoky wood, but still showing good sweet fruits and fresh acidity. The tannins need time to settle down as the essentially rich wine matures. Hold for 3–4 years.",89,24.0,Burgundy,Beaune,Pinot Noir,Maison Champy
Spain,"Earthy but sharp on the nose, with a foreboding sense of stem and sourness. The palate is indeed raw and acidic, with lean, slightly stemmy flavors of herbs, raspberry and plum. Not bad but carries a stemmy, less-than-pure personality.",84,14.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo,Campo Viejo
US,"Soft and tired, with baked cherry-berry flavors and a spicy finish.",82,9.0,California,California,Merlot,Camelot
France,"This wine shows that top Chablis should be aged. This is like tasting the barebones of the wine without the flesh that is still very hidden. There is suppressed power, as well as green acidity and potential richness. Wait 5 years.",93,59.0,Burgundy,Chablis,Chardonnay,Jean-Marc Brocard
France,"Boasts assertive strawberry and lime aromas, but drops off a bit on the palate, courtesy of relatively low acidity.",83,10.0,Languedoc-Roussillon,Vin de Pays des Côtes de Thau,Rosé,Bieler Père et Fils

US,"A good, serviceable expression of a Russian River Pinot that's ready to drink now. Dry and crisp, it shows oak-infused flavors of cherries, red currants, cola and mocha.",87,24.0,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Cuvée
France,"An intensely grassy wine, with green fruit and herb flavors, structured and laced with yeast from the lees. It has a hard edge from its straight-laced structure; it needs food.",85,20.0,Loire Valley,Menetou-Salon,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine de Chatenoy
Argentina,"Light and waxy on the nose, with touches of custard, lychee and banana. This is not a driving, varietally convincing Torrontés, but it is balanced and refreshing. The flavors of melon and apple are solid, while the finish is quick but nice. Drink right away and it shouldn't be a disappointment.",85,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Torrontés,Bodega Norton
France,"89-91 Barrel sample. A smoothly ripe wine, the tannins well integrated into the rich fruits. It has structure, layers of caramel and a good solid and firm character.",90,24.0,Bordeaux,Listrac-Médoc,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Fourcas Dupré
US,"The '98 Klipsun, from a premier vineyard on Red Mountain, is even better than the '97. It has a richness and ripeness in the cherry-flavored fruit, but retains the extra dimensions that Red Mountain soil imparts: flavors of iron, mineral and chalk. It's just a little hot in the finish, but not distractingly so. This is a very cleanly made wine, with no earthiness to it. As with all Seven Hills wines, it's built to age, though fine for near-term enjoyment. Editors' Choice.",92,25.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Seven Hills
US,"There's a drily tannic texture that gives this very ripe Cab structure and balance. Thoroughly dry, it tastes of red and black currants, smoky oak and peppery, dusty Asian spices. Gets better and better as it unfolds in the glass.",89,50.0,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon,Adelaida
France,"This herbaceous wine has fresh acidity and crisp, lively texture. Citrus and green apples are given a warmer character by spice and vanilla flavors. The wine is ripe and full in the mouth.",86,13.0,Bordeaux,Bordeaux Blanc,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Château Mezain
US,"Friendly and exuberant, exhibiting flavors of red berry, spice and pepper. Balanced but assertive; will pair well with a spicy pizza or pepper steak.",84,20.0,Idaho,Idaho,Syrah,Koenig Vineyards
US,"Produced from this famous cool-climate vineyard, the wine is zesty in acidity and dry, but enormously rich and impressive in pineapple and pear flavors, with a distinct minerality that makes it feel drier and earthier. It's a strong wine, but subtle. Drink now, but not too cold.",90,35.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay,Ken Brown
Spain,"Initial aromas of wet cement, black cherry and cassis grow more rubbery, reduced and animal-driven the longer this Syrah sits around. Bright, fresh and fiercely tannic, this deals dark-berry flavors, peppery spice and raw oak on top of dry, herbal notes. Oaky but not overly charred or pushy on the finish.",87,24.0,Catalonia,Alella,Syrah,Alta Alella
US,"Blended with a little Cabernet Franc, it's dry, smoothly tannic and ripe in black cherry jam, herb tea and sandalwood flavors. It's not ageable, but shows a certain elegance of structure.",90,35.0,California,Oak Knoll District,Merlot,Monticello Vineyards
US,"On a par with recent vintages, this four-year old Cab is soft and pleasant, with ripe cherry, blackberry, raspberry and herb flavors that are well oaked. The tannins are crunchy, but the wine isn't an ager. Best now through 2009.",87,27.0,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Arbios
US,"All of Le Cadeau's wines are made by different winemakers; here it is Chehalem's Harry Peterson-Nedry at the winemaking helm. He puts more emphasis on the herbal, leafy, somewhat resinous aspect of the grape, making a more Oregonian, less Burgundian style. Good intensity and focus carry it through an extended finish.",89,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Le Cadeau
US,"Dubbed Amerique because of the use of American oak barrels, this broad, relatively fruity, accessible Syrah splays out across the core palate with a panoply of blueberries, boysenberries, cooked cherries and cassis. That lush fruit plays out against firm tannins, a fine balancing act.",92,34.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Syrah,McCrea
France,"Like other wines from Blin, this seems to have some good bottle age, which has rounded out the naturally crisp character of the wine. The tight citrus flavor is soft, giving a fragrant, mouthfilling feel.",89,50.0,Champagne,Champagne,Chardonnay,H. Blin
US,"The opening is attractive, with mocha, raspberry and carob scents but it turns a bit tart in the mouth. Rustic tannins provide a backdrop for the char and vanilla flavors of the finish.",81,28.0,New Mexico,New Mexico,Dolcetto,La Chiripada
US,"This Pinot Noir, named for a particular soil type in the Willamette valley, is scented strongly of the lumber smell you get at a building supplies store. There is a simple but pleasing layer of strawberry/raspberry fruit hidden in the wine's core. Perhaps a year or two of bottle age will pull things together.",87,30.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Duck Pond
Italy,"Fresh and full of finesse, this radiant red offers rose, forest floor, woodland berry, new leather and pipe tobacco scents. The palate delivers juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry, wild herb and white pepper notes, finishing on star anise. Taut, refined tannins and bright acidity give it intensity, lift and balance. Give it time to develop to its full potential. Drink 2020–2032.",96,85.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,Sangiovese,Le Potazzine
US,"Bone dry and tartly crisp in acidity, this wine's lemongrass and grapefruit flavors are showing their age. It's just beginning to break up. Pretty good, but drink this year.",86,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Cali 351
US,"Charred wood is undeniably abundant, yet surprisingly integrated on the nose and palate of this Monticello Cab Franc amidst layers of spicy mocha chocolate and ripe black fruit. Richly extracted, yet elegant and clean in profile.",87,23.0,Virginia,Monticello,Cabernet Franc,Keswick Vineyards
US,"A simple but likeable Chard, with pretty apple and peach flavors and lots of crushed hard spices, like cinnamon and nutmeg. Has a touch of smoky oak. The K-J style really hasn't changed much over the years: Pick the grapes ripe, keep things slightly sweet and get some wood notes in.",84,11.0,California,California,Chardonnay,Kendall-Jackson
US,"From a classic producer who continues to do the variety justice, this Merlot is complex and concentrated. A taste of bright red plum and berry fruit intermingles with toasty oak and supple vanilla. The tannins are soft and a playful hint of herb marks the finish.",90,80.0,California,Sonoma County,Merlot,Pride Mountain

Italy,"A bright pink color characterizes this fragrant Bardolino Chiaretto. The wine boasts simple, clean lines with aromas of raspberry, pomegranate, white cherry and drying mineral. It's thin and fresh on the close and would make a great pairing partner to ravioli filled with cream and salmon sauce.",83,24.0,Veneto,Bardolino Chiaretto,Rosé,Ca' dei Rotti
Italy,"Here's a simple, straightforward Nero d'Avola from a relatively new estate located just steps away from the temples of Agrigento. The wine's aromas include sun-ripened fruit and cured meat.",86,12.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,Nero d'Avola,D'Alessandro
US,"Very dry, with mouth-watering acidity, but the palate also searches for a little more fruit than the wine offers. Still, the pineapples, peaches and apricots are pleasant enough.",88,33.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Chardonnay,Kunde
US,"When a young Pinot Noir is dominated by oak, as this one is, it's a little worrying. Will the oak be absorbed in time, or will it always be excessive? This young wine has pleasant cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors, but the oak seems to have the upper hand. Drink soon.",87,45.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir,Pfendler
Australia,"This supple, easy-drinking Cabernet features appealing ripe cassis and vanilla shadings. Hints of black cherry and graham cracker add nuance, while the texture is a bit creamy on the midpalate, turning dusty on the finish. Drink now–2020.",89,22.0,Western Australia,Margaret River,Cabernet Sauvignon,Howard Park

France,"A fine combination of toast and yellow fruit has produced an exotic, opulent wine that's ripe and generous. The balance is exactly right, while the richness of the wine doesn't lose sight of the lime acidity.",90,24.0,Burgundy,Pouilly-Fuissé,Chardonnay,Domaine Sangouard-Guyot
US,"This is pure Mourvèdre from Heart of the Hill and Ciel du Cheval vineyards. The Red Mountain terroir is on display in the form of a spicy cherry-pie flavor that is set off by minerality and dense, earthy tannins. A kiss of chocolate seals the deal.",90,45.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Mourvèdre,Syncline
Italy,"This is a simple, fruit-forward wine that ends on a bitter cherry note but that delivers spice, wild berry and raspberry along the way. You could stretch its pairing potential to include baked or fried fatty fish thanks to the linear and fresh feel the wine gives in the mouth.",86,24.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Cannonau di Sardegna,Cannonau,Meloni
Argentina,"More syrupy and chunky than ideal, but still a good wine with grilled meat, root beer and berry extract on the bouquet. The body seems a little baked and heavy, with molasses and raisin flavors mixing with blackberry. Finishes with melted brown sugar and soft tannins. A full, deep wine that shows a few signs of being overripe.",87,45.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Terrazas de Los Andes
France,"This has apricot and pear flavors, plus a nutmeg hint and intense, refreshing acidity.",89,30.0,Burgundy,Rully,Chardonnay,Antonin Rodet
US,"A full-bodied blend of 66% Mourvèdre, 30% Grenache and 4% Syrah bled off like a rosé and then fermented like a white wine, very reminiscent of a rosé from Provence. Dry, with prevailing flavors of strawberry and sweet spice, this Vin Gris is both pleasant enough to sip as an apéritif and bold enough to stand next to a range of food, seafood in particular.",89,16.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Rosé,Terre Rouge

A great springtime sipper.",87,10.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay,Badger Mountain
France,"Aged for 12 months in wood, this has lost some of the fresh, inimitable Chenin Blanc taste. But it has gained in intensity and ageability, the wood bringing out vanilla and dark toast flavors while still keeping the full, fat fruit. Age for four years and this will round out impressively.",90,24.0,Loire Valley,Anjou,Chenin Blanc,Château de Fesles
Spain,"Stalky, grassy, briny aromas of red-berry fruits run low on ripeness. This is tangy and tomatoey in feel, with tart plum and tomato flavors. A snappy, zesty, crisp finish is raw and cutting. Drink this wine now.",86,25.0,Catalonia,Montsant,Red Blend,Malondro

Italy,"This iconic Italian wine from Bolgheri's landmark Sassicaia vineyard (characterized by little rocks, or “sassi”) offers an elegant bouquet comprised in equal measure by mineral, fruit and spice nuances. The wine consists of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc and the finish is long, smooth and very fine. This is an ageworthy wine that should not be opened before 2018.",95,220.0,Tuscany,Bolgheri Sassicaia,Red Blend,Tenuta San Guido

Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",87,41.0,Burgundy,Saint-Aubin,Chardonnay,Olivier Leflaive
France,"Notes of beeswax, mirabelle plum compote and faint cardamom spice suggest a wine no longer in the first flush of youth. This is a compounded, rich but dry, layered but ultraclean wine. The palate reveals textured notes of gingerbread framed by the ripe fruit of ripe, dried yellow plums and even stored winter apple. There is just an echo of peach on the finish. This has lots of substance.",93,50.0,Alsace,Alsace,Gewürztraminer,René Muré

US,"This new vintage is sourced from a single block from the Dineen vineyard, and aged in 50% new French oak—the most ever. Black fruits abound, along with licorice, tar and a whiff of iodine. It's a tightly wound Syrah, with the stuffing and style to age for a decade or longer.",92,30.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Syrah,Stevens

Argentina,"Not a whole lot to say about the soft, flat nose. It's o.k., but that's really about it. The palate, meanwhile, turns sweet, nearly to the point of candied. And the finish is downright sugary. Decent weight and feel help it along.",82,14.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Chardonnay,Zolo

Italy,"A strange perfume comes off this wine; it's almost like soap dish meets daisies, and while that's not bad it's not that wine-like either. Flavors of apple cider and chunky melon are standard and soft. Not a ton of finish or flair.",84,18.0,Southern Italy,Fiano di Avellino,Fiano,Feudi di San Gregorio
US,"An ultrarich Cabernet whose ripe fruit is as elaborate as you can get. Ditto for the soft, plush tannins and the wealth of fine, sweet oak. Despite the wealth of blackberry, currant, dark chocolate and cola flavors, it's not a wine to drink now, because the tannins and acids are so pert. Give it a good six years in the cellar.",94,235.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Paul Hobbs
Italy,"This is a ramato Pinot Grigio (which means “copperish” in color) that boasts pinkish highlights of peach and amber. The wine delivers a steady stream of pear, cranberry and citrus aromas and washes clean over the palate thanks to its lively acidity.",87,22.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,Pinot Grigio,Comelli
Italy,"Opaque and very dark in color and flavor, toasty oak is handsomely wrapped around the black-cherry and plum fruit. Shows a slight animal note. Well textured and full, almost viscous, in the mouth, it finishes long with a nice blend of black-licorice, cherry and clove notes.",90,35.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,Sangiovese,Riecine

US,"This is all Birch Creek vineyard fruit, barrel fermented and put through full malolactic. It's soft, fleshy and buttery, with good ripe light tropical fruit, lots of barrel flavor, and enough acid to support it all. Both Rulo Chardonnays are perfect expressions of their style—one oaked, one unoaked—each in fine balance and proportion.",91,20.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Chardonnay,Rulo
US,"As usual, this is one of Calera's lightest bottlings, in both color and texture. It's deceptively simple, showing softened cola and raspberry jam flavors that finish impressively long and spicy. It would be a mistake to dismiss it for early drinking. Give it a good six years in the cellar, and it could be stunning in 2020.",92,55.0,California,Mt. Harlan,Pinot Noir,Calera
Spain,"A bit heavy and raisiny, but with that said there's no denying the wine's richness and ripeness. Lush and dense in the mouth, with cocoa, roasted fruit and a mild syrupy lean to the flavor profile. Sweet but a little short on the finish, and condensed. Drink now through 2012.",89,29.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Tempranillo Blend,García Figuero
Italy,"Fresh and linear, this offers spring wild flower and white stone fruit aromas while the luminous palate offers Bosc pear, citrus and a hint of white almond. It has a bright, slightly tangy finish.",88,20.0,Veneto,Soave Classico,White Blend,Gianni Tessari
US,"A very nice Cabernet from Paso Robles. At the age of five–plus years, it's still pretty tannic, but a good steak will cut through the hardness. Dry and balanced, it shows spicy flavors of blackberries, currants, anise and cocoa, accented with smoky oak. Should last for a long time, without gaining much.",87,26.0,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon,D'Anbino
US,"A great, enjoyable Chardonnay, extremely rich and ripe, but perfectly balanced. Crisp coastal acidity provides a clean boost to the enormous tropical fruit and peach flavors. The oak is strong, but in keeping with the size of the fruit, providing crème brûlée, buttered toast and smoky meringue opulence.",94,39.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay,Testarossa
France,"A spicy wine that unfolds with a gentle texture, touches of lychee and pear and fruitiness. It has richness rather than sweetness, finishing with a light touch of acidity.",87,24.0,Alsace,Alsace,Pinot Gris,Jean-Baptiste Adam
US,"The powerful flavors of this Syrah are both its strength and weakness. No question it's a delicious wine, upfront in blackberry pie filling, currant, licorice, dark chocolate and peppery spices. However the very power of flavor makes it hard to pair with subtle food. Best with strong plates, like short ribs or beef tamales.",87,30.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Syrah,Dogwood
Italy,"An enticing fragrance of rose, blue flower, incense and truffle wafts out of the glass. On the palate, accents of black pepper, espresso and licorice add depth to the bright cherry-berry fruit, while polished tannins give it a smooth, silky texture. It's well balanced and fresh. Drink 2018–2030.",92,113.0,Piedmont,Barbaresco,Nebbiolo,Ca'Romè
Spain,"Baked raisiny aromas of spice cake are almost overdone. Like many 2009 RDDs, this is huge, tannic and massive as a whole. A woody flavor profile includes earthy jammy berry fruit, while this is heavy with campfire notes on the finish. This is 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink through 2023.",91,80.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Balbas
Spain,"Pickle and sweet funk on the nose give this chunky wine a nose that's less than fresh. Flavors of orange, peach and cantaloupe are sweet but flat, and in the end it tastes more like a fruit juice than a really solid dry rosé.",83,13.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo,Darien
Italy,"Here's a dark pink, almost red rosé (from oak-aged Syrah grapes) with aromas of wild berry, forest floor and bitter almond. The wine is tart and tangy and ends with a touch of crisp acidity that would pair with ham, cold cuts or thinly sliced roast beef.",87,20.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Rosé,I Giusti e Zanza
US,"Shows the dryness, crisp acidity, flowers and minerality that often mark Carneros Chadonnays, which makes it elegant and sleek. With a touch of Meyer lemons and limes, it rises to richness.",87,18.0,California,Carneros,Chardonnay,Highway 12
US,"This is Cecil De Loach's brand, since he sold his winery to Boisset USA, and it's a nice Russian River Cab of which there aren't many.

US,"Dryness marks this elegant Pinot Noir, a remarkable feat since the strawberry and raspberry fruit is so opulently ripe. With fresh acidity, firm tannins and a touch of minerals, it's a wonderful expression of Santa Rita fruit.",93,30.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot Noir,Dolina
Italy,"Thanks to careful clonal selection, this bright Vermentino shows a pristine quality. It is redolent of pear, peach and honey, and it shows a touch of dried herb on the finish.",88,15.0,Tuscany,Maremma Toscana,Vermentino,Carpineto
Italy,"This Barolo from the Cannubi vineyard opens with a delicate aromatic embroidery of vanilla, forest berry, cola, spice and licorice. The texture here is tight, fine and very silky and those characteristic Nebbiolo flavors last a long time on the finish. You could save this wine five to 10 more years and pair it with slow-cooked duck confit.",92,58.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Comm. G. B. Burlotto
France,"The idea that Sauvignon Blanc cannot age is emphatically disproved by this impressive, mature wine. It is rich and concentrated, full of almonds, herbs and a great sense of length and ripeness. This is now perfectly ready to drink.",93,45.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine Laporte
US,"The newest Ursa is 50% Merlot, 24% Cab Franc, 17% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot, and it is absolutely delicious right out of the chute; no breathing needed. It's got plump and sweetly juicy cherry and berry fruit flavors, mixed in with cherry candy, red licorice, anise and spice. Good persistence and length.",90,39.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Red Blend,Baer
Italy,"This vintage of Solengo is slightly more floral and delicate when compared to the more robust and generous 2004 vintage. The wine is deep and penetrating with lingering aromas of forest berry and rose petal and exhibits remarkable harmony. It's still tight in the mouth with fine texture and length—unique and distinctive, with gorgeous feminine and floral intensity. Drink after 2010.",93,88.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Red Blend,Argiano
Argentina,"Pronounced oak is the opening blast, and amid the shy red berry and tomato leaf aromas there are hints of leather, mint and coconut. All these scents indicate that heavy wood was thrown at the wine, so while the power and goals of the wine are admirable, it's weighed down presently by a touch too much resin. Maybe that'll drift with time but that's not for sure.",88,35.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Malbec,Doña Paula
US,"A good, sound red wine, made from the five Bordeaux varieties. It's dry and gently tannic, with herb, tobacco and black cherry flavors.",84,22.0,California,Sonoma County,Claret,St. Francis

Shows proper blackberry, black currant and herb flavors, with a balanced touch of oak. Ready now.",87,25.0,California,El Dorado,Meritage,Miraflores
Argentina,"There is a select group of under-$20 Malbecs from Argentina that really do the country and the variety proud. Santos is one of them; the 2006 is easy and ripe on the nose, with lovely cola, berry and herb aromas. The palate has a natural feel and bright black-fruit flavors. Not overly complex but a winner for the next year or two.",91,18.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Ricardo Santos
US,"The alcohol level is very high, but the wine is very delicious, which is the tradeoff you get with this Zinfandel taste-alike. It's silky and soft and rich in jammy raspberry, cherry and chocolate flavors, finished with savory spices.",87,32.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Primitivo,Collier Falls

US,"An intricately layered nose of sagebrush, blood, pencil lead, soy, beef jerky, lilac, violet, lavender and tight cranberries shows on this stunning wine from the historic vineyard. The palate offers rounded red fruits and cherry tomatoes that tighten around a sagebrush core, bolstered by lots of oregano, black pepper, dried basil and eucalyptus.",94,41.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Noir,Kynsi

France,"With some weight behind it, this is a ripe Champagne, with cherry and raspberry fruit and attractive lime acidity. There is a good bite in the aftertaste.",86,45.0,Champagne,Champagne,Champagne Blend,Château de Bligny
Argentina,"Cherry and plum-like aromas carry a dry, dusty edge and some stem, but as a whole this wine is light on its feet, easy to drink and proper. The flavors are quite red in scope, with a twinge of buttery oak adding softness. Licorice and another tick of wood take care of the finish. A fresh, forward wine for everyday use.",86,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Santa Julia
US,"One of the winery's sweeter wines, this Pinot Noir-based bubbly has jammy raspberry, strawberry and vanilla flavors. Ultra-crisp acidity provides needed balance. It's a little heavy, but will appeal to those who want some sugar in their sparkling wine.",87,33.0,California,Green Valley,Sparkling Blend,Iron Horse
US,"Tired of oaky fruit bomb Chards? This one's notable for structure. Crisp acidity and a firm streak of minerals undergird the grilled pineapple, cinnamon apple sauce and buttered toast flavors. Drink this elegant wine now.",90,32.0,California,Carneros,Chardonnay,Roessler
US,"Seems made in a less ripe style, a minty, wintergreen wine with hints of barely ripened blackberries and some briary wild berries. Drinks bone dry and fairly tannic. If you're into an earthier, more French Bordeaux style, try this one. Will benefit from a decade of aging.",89,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Elyse

The wine is supple, rich and opulent on the close. Cellar it five years or more.",93,24.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Grimaldi Bruna
Argentina,"A touch soupy and leafy on the nose, with a green element as well. The palate feel is clacky and firm, with herbal berry and green finishing flavors. Better in terms of feel and structure than flavors and aromas; a marginal Cab from a cool year.",83,15.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Cabernet Sauvignon,Piattelli
US,"Palmaz has struggled to break into the top ranks, and this 2006 does not advance their cause. It smells funky and vegetal, although it turns fairly rich in the mouth, with cherries, red licorice, cocoa and cedar. Doesn't seem likely to improve over time.",86,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Palmaz
US,"From Stillwater Creek vineyard, this 80/20 blend of Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon simply tastes young. The fruit is ripe enough, but superficial, with a lot of barrel flavors providing the weight and filling in with smoke, toast and coffee. Malbec has a very promising future in Washington State, and it's good to see young and talented wineries such as Tildio doing the exploration. Right now, this is just a pleasant table wine.",85,28.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Malbec,Tildio
France,"One of the two luxury wines from Château d'Esclans, Les Clans is rich, wood-aged and full of ripe and rounded fruit flavors.

Remains sweet on the finish, with fig and minty spice flavors.",88,13.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Alamos
Italy,"Aromas of mature berry, menthol, coffee bean, toast and dark cooking spice emerge on this bracing wine. The firmly structured palate delivers dried black cherry, espresso, French oak, licorice, chopped herb and tobacco set against bracing, close-grained tannins and the warmth of alcohol. The tannins will need years to unwind.",90,110.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Ceretto

Australia,"This compelling wine delivers a tidal wave of chocolate, dark berries, earth and black olive aromas and flavors.

Drink now-2025.",94,105.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,Shiraz,Kilikanoon
Argentina,"Fairly round aromas of blackberry are also slightly grapey, while the plump palate offers dark fruit flavors and a choppy mouthfeel.

US,"One of the best Zinfandels of the vintage. This wine is exuberant in wild berry, briary, brambly nettle, cola, red currant, licorice and bacon flavors, with Zin's peppery spiciness.

US,"This wine feels a bit awkward in the mouth; the flavors don't quite connect. The light fruit flavors run to strawberry and watermelon—odd for Cabernet—and the mid-palate drops into a thin, hot and hard finish. There is some softness which makes it a quaffable, but generic red.",83,15.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Columbia Winery

Argentina,"All sorts of smoky berry, cola and controlled toast aromas get this wine going in the right direction.

US,"This could be labeled Cabernet Sauvignon, which is 80% of the blend. It's all old vine Champoux vineyard fruit, with a beguiling blend of herb, bramble, spice, cedar and chocolate.

On the finish expect tar and espresso.",87,24.0,California,High Valley,Red Blend,Brassfield
US,Pushes Zinfandel to the limit of balance. The alcohol is nearly 16%. The tannins are hard. The blackberry and currant flavors wander into raisins. Yet on the plus side is extreme dryness and a certain complexity and curiosity value.,87,35.0,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel,Rock Wall

France,"Ripe red raspberry notes, accented by cocoa, a chalky minerality and a hint of orange zest liven up the medium weight.

Best now through 2010.",92,48.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Hendry

Italy,"Here's a truly astonishing Barolo (from the Bricco Gattera cru) that epitomizes the “big boy” style that represents one of two dominant winemaking philosophies in the Langhe.

Spain,"Raisiny, sweet and baked, with plenty of oak coming on as it airs out. This vintage is somewhat syrupy and strained compared to prior years, with baked black fruit flavors.

US,"This is one of the larger, more imponderable Pinots I've tasted this year, meaning that it has the heft of something from the Rhône, perhaps a Grenache, although it never loses Pinot's silkiness. It's tremendous and forward in jammy cherries, raspberries and cola, and while it's dry, it has the sweet finish of an extremely ripe wine. Enormously complicated, it's an eccentric Pinot, but one you'll probably reach for again and again. From the esteemed Hyde and Hudson vineyards.",93,80.0,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,Ambullneo

US,"A beautiful, complex and compelling wine that shows how well Napa can perform at Sauvignon Blanc, if it really wants to. It moves to the front ranks for its dryness, crispness and elegance, while delivering plenty of delicious flavor. Pineapples, lemons and limes flood the mouth, without the slightest grassy unripeness, and with a tantalizing hint of flowers and minerals. Totally elegant and sophisticated, a great white wine for the finest fare.",93,33.0,California,Rutherford,Sauvignon Blanc,Modus Operandi

It's full-bodied but not necessarily a heavy wine, with sweetness and chocolate but not much nuance or complexity. Drink now–2009.",90,25.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Cabernet Sauvignon,Kaiken

US,"Although it says dry, there's a honeyed edge of sweetness to this crisp, delicate wine. The acidity is a welcome balance to the flowery citrus, apricot and mango flavors.",87,16.0,California,High Valley,Riesling,Brassfield
US,"I'm not sure Howell Mountain is the best place for Merlot, because the dry, rugged terrain imparts strong tannins that seem weird in this supposedly gentle red variety. This 100% Merlot has big cherry, blackberry, cocoa and sweet new oak flavors wrapped in a firmly astringent, sandpapery texture. Decanting will help. So will a rich, fatty steak.",88,75.0,California,Howell Mountain,Merlot,Luna
Argentina,"This overly ripe Malbec is packed with rooty spice, oak and tree bark aromas. The wine feels sticky and soupy, with a resiny texture and salty, oaky flavors of syrupy berries and mint. A sugary, cloying finish is short on freshness.",83,12.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Siesta Wines
Australia,"This medium-bodied Riesling may have just a touch of residual sugar to help bulk it up, but it stays true to the variety's floral, spice-scented nature. Green apple and lime flavors are crisply defined, finishing with contrasting sensations of chalky minerality and fruit syrup.",85,10.0,South Australia,South Australia,Riesling,Stonehaven
Italy,"Sassicaia has been showing amazing results in recent years, and the 2009 vintage opens with all the intensity and beauty you should expect of Italy's flagship super Tuscan.

Drink after 2020.",96,227.0,Tuscany,Bolgheri Sassicaia,Red Blend,Tenuta San Guido
Spain,"As expected, the wine exhibits a dense black color, with mineral, burnt toast and dark fruit on the bouquet. The flavor profile offers cured meat, leather, graphite and plenty of blackberry, mocha, caramel and coffee. Beautiful modern Rioja. 4,000 cases made. Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",96,57.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo,Viñedos de Paganos
US,"Pretty as all get-out, this wine is a floral masterpiece—a study in coastal rose and forest scents with a counterpunch of white pepper that leaves one wanting more. Juicy raspberry, strawberry and tangerine flavors are seasoned in allspice and tobacco, the palate so beautifully delicate yet fully realized in savory complexity and length.",98,75.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
US,"This is a generous, likable Syrah for drinking soon. It's dark in color, full-bodied and dry, with ripe flavors of blackberries, plums, cola, anise, sandalwood and peppery spices. The soft tannins help the wine finish rich and silky.",89,35.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Syrah,Wrath

Italy,"Here's a slightly more sophisticated and evolved Barbera d'Asti from the 2008 vintage. There are notes of fresh fruit, spice, wet earth and a touch of natural rubber. The wine is exceedingly crisp, clean and polished in the mouth. Very nice, simple and pure.",89,24.0,Piedmont,Barbera d'Asti,Barbera,Scagliola

US,"This Bordeaux blend, based on equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is softly opulent and ripe, in the way of many Paso Robles red wines. It floods the mouth with blackberries and currants, with spicy complexities from oak, and is fairly tannic, although not so much that a good steak won't cut through it. Best Now–2012.",88,59.0,California,Paso Robles,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,HammerSky

US,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is a more subtle, and more interesting wine than the winery's Cab Franc. Here the ripeness seems more stable and balanced, with just the right hints of leaf and bark, and a subtle suggestion of chocolate. The finish is smooth and textural, and a bit of coffee kicks in right at the end; very nice.",90,45.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sheridan Vineyard
US,"Fantastically rich and sweet, with vast, deep flavors of honey, apricots, tangerines, vanilla and spices. The residual sugar is 13.3%. We humans are hard-wired to love this level of sweetness, but a minor quibble is that the acidity isn't high enough to provide ultimate balance.",89,35.0,California,Anderson Valley,Gewürztraminer,Castello di Amorosa
France,"Mouth- tingling freshness in a very crisp, dry wine that lives up to its Zéro Dosage moniker. It is all about green apples, freshly sliced lemon, a taut minerality. A few months bottle age will help to bring out a rounder, yeasty character.",90,43.0,Champagne,Champagne,Pinot Noir,Drappier
Italy,Penon Pinot Bianco is a fragrant and intense white wine with aromas of stone fruit and white rose splashed over a dense and creamy mouthfeel. This beautiful white wine would match northern Italian dishes such as paper-thin lasagna with a poppy seed cream filler.,90,20.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,Pinot Bianco,Nals Margreid
US,"Spicy cranberry/raspberry fruit is the whole story here. It's fresh, acidic, forward and spicy, then tails off quickly into a tannic finish. The last impression is of earth and stems, slightly bitter and astringent.",86,26.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Noir,Benton-Lane
US,"This was one of the best Rieslings of the year last vintage, and the '07 is even better. It's absolutely dry and superbly racy. Acidity, at .82, is one of the highest I've seen in years. Balancing that is a broad, complex array of citrus, peach, apple, flower, petrol, mineral and spice flavors. If California Riesling is making a comeback, it's because of wines like this.",92,24.0,California,Marin County,Riesling,Pey-Marin
US,"This is three fifths Merlot, with the other four Bordeaux grapes filling out the rest. 100% French oak was used, half new, and the near-15% alcohol shows in a bit of burn in the finish. Toasty, smoky, laden with roasted coffee and bitter chocolate notes, this is a wine to pair with a grilled steak.",89,24.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Davenport Cellars

The wine is firm and and focused with finely textured tannins.",90,90.0,Tuscany,Toscana,Cabernet Franc,Duemani
US,"Made in the modern cult style, this 100% varietal Cabernet is soft and lush. While it's technically dry, it tastes sweet, the result of ripe fruit, high alcohol and lots of charry new oak. Shows oodles of chocolate, black currant and plum flavors that end in a swirl of Asian spices. Now through 2012.",91,60.0,California,St. Helena,Cabernet Sauvignon,Rockledge Vineyards

Italy,"This is a knockout wine with amazing extraction and power that fuels a long, pleasurable experience. The wine opens with aromas of black cherry, chocolate fudge, exotic spice, mesquite and asphalt. It's supple and dense with touches of sweet spice on the fade.",93,58.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Begali
Italy,"Very big and dark, the deep cherry fruit here is cloaked—some might say overshadowed—by the intensity of the oak. Still, it possesses a stylish, suave quality and a good mouthfeel, even if it loses some typicity in the robe of international-style toast. Will be better in two or three years.",87,25.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,Sangiovese,Terrabianca

Argentina,"Pronounced oak is the opening blast, and amid the shy red berry and tomato leaf aromas there are hints of leather, mint and coconut. All these scents indicate that heavy wood was thrown at the wine, so while the power and goals of the wine are admirable, it's weighed down presently by a touch too much resin. Maybe that'll drift with time but that's not for sure.",88,35.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,Malbec,Doña Paula

France,"Produced by Domaine Laporte (itself owned by Henri Bourgeois), this wine is firmly in the modernist camp of Sancerre. But I also has some complexity, with light, poised flavors of currants and crisp acidity. This is more of a food wine than an apéritif, and would also work well with Asian dishes. Imported by Martine's Wines.",88,25.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine du Rochoy

Italy,"Clean and medium in weight, with apple, pineapple and a shot of mineral to the nose. Pure citrus and sunshine in the mouth, with a finish of orange peel and pepper. Acidic and snappy, but crafty. Simple yet solid. Imported by Vias Imports.",87,34.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,Grillo,Marco de Bartoli
Argentina,"Clean, straightforward aromas of berry, cassis and mineral are nice, while the palate has ample lushness, purity and focus. Flavors of cola, black currant and blackberry are solid, and the finish keeps its pose. On the money for a regular, journeyman's Malbec.",88,20.0,Other,Neuquén,Malbec,Familia Schroeder
Italy,"This is a super-intense wine that might not appeal to everyone. The aromas are wide reaching, immediate and recall almond Amaretto, candied orange, brown sugar and molasses. The wine is chewy and soft in the mouth and leaves strong marzipan flavors and a playful touch of sweetness.",87,19.0,Northeastern Italy,Colli Orientali del Friuli,Friulano,Antico Broilo
Italy,"This 100% Syrah wine opens with ripe black-skinned fruit, roasted coffee, leather and cedar aromas.

US,"Almost as perfect a Stags Leap Cabernet as you can find, showing lush, opulent and immediately appealing flavors. Blackberries, plums, cassis, dark chocolate and sweet oak combine in a spicy swirl. The tannins are fiercely soft, an oxymoron that suggests the wine's complexity. Yet those same tannins are astringent enough to warrant time in the cellar. Hold until 2014, at least.",94,65.0,California,Stags Leap District,Cabernet Sauvignon,Baldacci

Good density, and a smoky quality infuses the finish.",89,32.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Kontos
Australia,"If the Liandra is Bratasiuk's Côte-Rôtie, this is the wine he calls “more Hermitage.” And it does have some iron-like, minerally notes to it. But there's more New World suppleness and flesh as well, featuring lush plum and cassis fruit, some hickory-smoked bacon and layers of coffee and cream on the lengthy finish. Approachable now, but should be even better in five years and will easily last for 10–15.",95,100.0,South Australia,Clarendon,Syrah,Clarendon Hills
US,"A fantastic Cabernet that stuns now for authenticity and power, and should develop for many years. Despite the large production, lower than that of many first growth Bordeaux, the wine, which has tiny amounts of Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, shows classic Oakville elegance and precision. Rich in black currants, blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate, it should hit its stride from 2011 through 2017.",96,125.0,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon,Far Niente

US,"This blend of 35% Sonoma, 33% Santa Barbara and 32% Monterey grapes shows the intensity and depth of flavor that careful grape selection and knowledgeable blending can achieve. The wine is full and forward, with mango, pear, pineapple, popcorn and very toasty oak boldly coating the palate. Just a touch unsubtle, it's still very delicious, and finishes with butterscotch and nutmeg.",89,32.0,California,California,Chardonnay,Landmark
US,"This is a Zin for the cellar. It's fine now in rich fruit, but fairly tannic, and there's some tension of parts that 3–4 years should resolve.

The challenge with these big Zins is balance, which Sanctuary's '06 achieves.",93,25.0,California,Mendocino Ridge,Zinfandel,Sanctuary

US,"Lots of exotic flavors in this barrel-fermented Chardonnay. Its deep in gold color, indicating richness and oak, and follows through with pineapples, mangos, tangerine sorbet, buttered toast, buttercotch, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice. Great price for a Chard this good.",93,24.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay,Pali

Argentina,"This is a blend of Cab Sauvignon, Malbec and Merlot that's agile, fresh and offers good mouthfeel.

US,"Some will criticize this Chardonnay for being too oaky and sweet, but it sure is delicious. It just brims with pineapple, yellow apricot, crème brûlée, honey and buttered toast flavors that are balanced with crisp acidity. If you like that California style, you'll love this opulent wine.",90,32.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay,Foxen
US,"Crushed slate minerality drives the nose of this bottling, with boysenberry and dried beef touches. That meaty character carries into the palate as well, rich with iron and a tad bitter, accenting dried blueberry, thyme and oregano flavors.",87,30.0,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Franc,Sarzotti
US,"The nose is fruity and candied, with melon, apple, some sweet citrus. Some sweet cracker also; the finish is fairly quick and the acid (at 14% alcohol) is not really giving it the vivid structure you might expect.",86,13.0,Washington,Rattlesnake Hills,Riesling,Hudson Shah

Spain,"Aromas of chewing gum dust, lime and wet stones are simple and clean. This Viura is equally light and citrusy on the palate, with moderately briny flavors of lime and white grapefruit. A mild palate doesn't bring anything new to the game.",87,15.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Viura,CVNE

Argentina,"If you want ripe-fruit aromas and flavors along with spice, pepper and coffee accents, this well-oaked but reasonably restrained Malbec is your ticket. The flavors run closer to raspberry and strawberry than many big Malbecs, and the texture and balance are just right. This wine delivers the maximum given its price and pedigree.",89,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Trapiche
US,"A fine Sauvignon Blanc that delivers plenty of bang for the buck. It's highlighted by brisk, clean acidity and ripe, delicious flavors of oranges, limes and papayas, with savory, palate-tingling spices.

Seductive and smooth, this is an elegant wine that warrants cellaring.",90,50.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Cadaretta
France,"Straddling richness and beautiful liveliness, this is going to be an impressive wine. It does need aging. At this stage, the wood is a big element, but then the bright white fruits—pears, white currants along with tangerines—will move center stage. Keep at least six years, almost certainly more.",95,328.0,Burgundy,Chevalier-Montrachet,Chardonnay,Bouchard Père & Fils
US,"This is sourced from several Milbrandt vineyards, and a blend of both barrel (one third) and tank (two thirds) fermented grapes.

The fruit is solid, ripe and full, but one dimensional.",88,35.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay,Mark Ryan
Italy,"The Brunate cru, with denser soils, is known for meatier, more structured wines.

Just explodes in the mouth with massive flavors of blackberry and black cherry jam, milk chocolate, anise, cedar and pepper.

Spain,"Very dark and oaky, with lemon, bacon, charcoal and high-toned black fruit aromas. The palate is rich and warm, almost heavy, with intense blackberry, chocolate and figgy flavors.

US,"Rich, ripe blackberry, cherry, mocha, anise and cedar flavors mark this 100% Cabernet. The tannins are evident in a puckery astringency, but it's not too hard to drink it now with tannin-busting foods, like steak. Shows a classy, Napa-esque flashiness, although it doesn't seem to be an ager.",91,110.0,California,St. Helena,Cabernet Sauvignon,Etude

Argentina,"Piercing leather, berry and foresty aromas lead to a zesty palate of medicinal cherry and raspberry flavors.

Tastes pretty good but rides rough and bumpy.",84,11.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,Cabernet Sauvignon,Andeluna
France,"With an unusually high proportion (nearly 17%) of Petit Verdot in the blend, this is both darkly structured and dark in color. It is weight, intense youthful acidity and black-currant fruits.

Spain,"Heavy and mealy on the nose, with stalky white-fruit aromas. The palate is weighty and sticky, with a cloying feel and sweet, baked flavors of apple and honey.

Probably best in another year or two.",87,14.0,Australia Other,Central Ranges,Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon,Inkberry

US,"Stiff, tannic, earthy and wrapped up tight. It's a big, bruiser of a wine, oaky, earthy and showing liquorous barrel flavors. Tasted three times over a four month period, it remains quite tight and hidden; the fruit is there but it's very difficult to get this wine to open up. In time, therating could significantly improve.",89,45.0,Washington,Red Mountain,Red Blend,Mark Ryan

US,"This top-of-the-line Chardonnay from Columbia Crest gets extra time in barrel and bottle, and comes from the much-heralded 1998 vintage. It's a rich, creamy style, with less obvious buttery oak than the Grand Estates, but more complexity and a thicker, more complex feel to it. Flavors mix fruit, wood, spice and herb evenly. It has a comforting feeling of weight to it; it's not just up-front, aggressive flavors. Editors' Choice.",90,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay,Columbia Crest
US,"Shows the superripe qualities of this vintage in the fruit that runs from sun-warmed blackberries through cherry pie, kirsch and cassis, and also the soft, gentle tannins. Lots of oak, too.

Spain,"Solid if a bit soupy and tomato-driven on the nose. In the mouth, there's a nice offset between herbal, red fruit characteristics, tobacco and black fruit.

Spain,"Shows some meat and heft on the nose along with leather, rubber and black fruit. Solid and generic across the palate, with black cherry and berry flavors that are good and steady.

US,"Like all of Reverie's 2007 reds, this one's super-tannic. In fact, it's one of the hardest, most astringent Napa Cabs on the market. Still, it has a rich core of blackberries and currants, with lots of smoky oak, and the spicy fruit lasts a long time on the finish. A good sign for cellaring. Try after 2013.",91,65.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon,Reverie
Spain,"A big-time Priorato with tobacco, minerality and dark fruit aromas in front of a lush and smooth palate full of cola, blackberry and licorice flavors.

Drink from 2011 through 2015.",92,34.0,Catalonia,Priorat,Red Blend,Costers del Priorat
France,"A concentrated, rich wine, packed with peach and pear flavors, the freshness coming from ripe apples and green plums.

US,"Fully mature now, although it still has a good six years left, this shows why certain Zins benefit from aging. Tight and tannicly dry to begin with, it has aged to something approaching Pinot-like delicacy, although the wild berry, roasted coffee and spice flavors are Zinny, and few Zinfandels will ever have these tannins.",92,25.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Zinfandel,Joseph Swan Vineyards
US,"The aromas are near completely closed up on first pour, with whiffs of marionberry, herb and barrel spice. The palate brings dense tightly wound fruit flavors.

US,"Sweet and sexy, this notable Merlot value offers berry, earth, herb and cocoa elements knit into a smooth, appealing package. There's a touch of Bordeaux Right Bank complexity in the bouquet, then decidedly New World ripe black cherries and toasty oak on the palate. Finishes spicy-sweet, with a caramel note from the oak. Drink now–2003.",88,18.0,California,Monterey County,Merlot,Lockwood
US,"Light daffodil aromas meet with lemon curd, wet slate and the slightest touch of green apple skins.

The finish is nicely mouth-watering.",87,25.0,California,Monterey County,Sauvignon Blanc,Byington
Italy,"Here's a perfectly correct and clean Pinot Grigio from Tuscany that shows evidence of a deft and technologically savvy team of winemakers.

Argentina,"A wine of character. The bouquet takes time to unfold, dealing earthy aromas and desert sage. Flavors of black cherry and cassis are firm and forceful, while the tannins are pronounced. A little clumsy and rugged now; should be better in a year or so.",89,19.0,Mendoza Province,Uco Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Salentein

Drink over the next 6–9 months.",90,16.0,Rhône Valley,Côtes du Rhône,Rhône-style White Blend,André Brunel
France,"The fruit from 40-year-old vines is reticent about showing its character at this young stage. However, in two to three years, the rich and concentrated citrus flavors and steely structure will take over and reveal a dense wine that is aromatic as well as serious. Drink from 2016.",90,17.0,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling,Jean-Marc Bernhard
France,"The Northern Rhône's most important co-op's 2010 Saint-Joseph is impressive, offering complex beef and pepper aromas that merge seamlessly with swirls of tart cherry fruit and hints of oak.

France,"With its wonderful poise between dark structure and intensely fragrant fruit, this is firm, dry and packed with ripe blackberry fruits.

US,"Good and dry, but awkward, with slightly vegetal flavors sticking through riper ones of blackberries and black currants. The acid-tannin relationship also is unbalanced. Redeems itself on the finish, with a flourish of chocolate.",84,65.0,California,Lake County,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Alienor
France,"A remarkable wine that manages effortlessly to bring together ripe apricot and sweet pear flavors with a balanced maturity that is so delicious. It has power and richness, but there is also minerality and a hint of a chalky texture. This 1999 needs less aging than previous vintages and can be drunk now.",93,128.0,Champagne,Champagne,Chardonnay,Pol Roger
US,"This vineyard bottling is very vintage driven. The cool 2009 harvest has made it ripe and tart in cherry pie flavors, but also rather tannic. It's aloof, revealing little of its soul, beyond the primary fruit and oak. Needs time in the cellar. Could really be interesting over the next decade.",90,45.0,California,Mt. Harlan,Pinot Noir,Calera
US,"The winery's best Vista Verde ever. Terrific in crisp acidity and finely meshed tannins that frame ripe, rich flavors of cherry pulp, root beer, anise and oak that finish long and impressively delicious.

Italy,"Here's an attractively informal Prosecco from Adami with a sweet, creamy mouthfeel and pristine aromas of peach, honey and apricot. It's not as intense as the other wines released by this producer, but it makes an excellent and informal appetizer wine nonetheless.",87,15.0,Veneto,Prosecco,Glera,Adami
US,"An enticing, heavy-duty blend of 40% Viognier, 40% Petit Manseng and 20% Roussanne, this is rich, round and unctuous, with bold notes of golden stone fruit, orange Creamsicle, lemon tartlet and caramelized nut. The acidity is soft across the midpalate, but it brightens on the warm, medium-length finish. To appreciate the full spectrum of aromas and flavors, don't drink this too cold.",88,30.0,Virginia,Virginia,White Blend,Tarara
US,"This wine is formulaic in a good way; L'Ecole “owns” Sémillon in Washington, and it is hard to think of any winery in the country that does a better job with the grape. Aged sur lie in neutral oak, blended with 14% Sauvignon Blanc and put through malolactic for added creaminess, this is a delicious, rich and succulent wine that deftly mixes flavors of nettle, lime and melon with vanilla custard and a hint of butterscotch.",90,16.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sémillon,L'Ecole No. 41

Argentina,"Sweet and a little foxy on the nose, with secondary aromas of air freshener.

US,"Showcases Zin's wild, almost savage side, with that briary, berry profile.  But it's very dry, thin and rasping, with scouring acidity and a lean, lean mouthfeel.

Argentina,"Ripe berry, cassis and grilled meat aromas presage a fresh, zesty palate with free-flowing acidity that pumps up cherry, red plum, cassis and loamy earth flavors.

Italy,"Now in its fourth generation, Tommasi is one of the most ardent ambassadors of Valpolicella wine tradition.

US,"This is a simple, soft wine with a good deal of charm. It's well made and easy to drink, with pretty black-cherry flavors that spread over the palate. The only drawback is an herbaceous quality that pervades both the aroma, where it's green and stalky, and the palate, where it's positively sharp. But at this price, these are minor quibbles.",84,9.0,California,California,Merlot,CK Mondavi

US,"Less ripe than Ravenswood's other Sonoma Zins, with an herbal edge to the cherry and cocoa flavors, and not as balanced. The tannins are more pronounced, too.",86,30.0,California,Alexander Valley,Zinfandel,Ravenswood
US,"Bogle continues to outperform nearly everybody else in their price range. Tasted alongside far more expensive Cabs, this wine performed well. It's dry and elegantly structured, with classic blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors. Production was an easy to find 175,000 cases.",87,11.0,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon,Bogle
Argentina,"Stick with Sur's basic 2005 Malbec because it's fresher and cleaner than this raisiny, tannic brooder that tastes a little too much of stewy fruit and liqueur.",84,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,Malbec,Sur de los Andes
US,"A very pleasant cherry-raspberry aroma and similarly fruity flavors bring a lot of appeal to this light-bodied and not very tannic wine. It's smooth and easy to drink, with no rough edges.",86,13.0,California,California,Red Blend,Kitchen Sink
Spain,"You wouldn't call this wine “clean and polished.” It has some old country brett along with fig, earth, mushroom and liqueur on the nose. That said, it's dishing up heavy servings of chocolate and baked berry pie flavors. A big, bulky wine that's already losing clarity. This won't be for everyone.",89,17.0,Northern Spain,Toro,Tinta de Toro,Bodegas Ramon Ramos
Spain,"Nice and familiar, and very much in the sweet, creamy style. There's almond candy and caramel on the palate and then maple syrup on the finish. Soft and sweet throughout, with just enough acidity and complexity to save it from being boring.",87,11.0,Andalucia,Jerez,Sherry,Osborne
Italy,"Light and tonic in appearance, this Etna-based wine is a profound expression of elegance. You'll get drying mineral tones backed by blue flower and sweet almond nut. The mouthfeel is polished and streamlined. Pair it with cold water fish or white meat.",90,43.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Etna,Red Blend,Girolamo Russo

US,"Ripe orange and papaya, spice, graham cracker and smoke are a few of the adjectives tasters used to describe the nose of this delightful wine. Though rich and open on the palate, it never gets loose or sloppy. A great chalk element and spice accents nicely offset the rich fruit foundation. Buttered toast and nutty, leesy notes mingle with pineapple on the long, finely balanced back end.",92,45.0,California,Carneros,Chardonnay,Fisher
US,"Delicate flavors of baking spices like cinnamon, allspice and ginger light up this very dry, firm-textured bubbly. Vivid acidity keeps it light and lively. Plenty of citrus and green apple notes and a refreshing dryness make the mouth water.",91,40.0,California,North Coast,Sparkling Blend,Schramsberg
US,"Rich and buttery, this has smoky oak and toast flavors that frame the pineapple and orange jam notes. Not overly complicated, this is made in a way that appeals to Chardonnay lovers. Production was a hefty 16,500 cases.",86,25.0,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay,William Hill Estate
US,"Violets, lovely and fragrant, leap from this broad, soft and open Merlot, loaded with beautiful sweet black fruit. The oak is showing a lot of toast now but that's not a criticism; this is really tasty, pleasing and a fine value.",90,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot,Seven Hills
US,"More tannic and substantial than the Merlot, this shows cool-climate flavors that bring out citrus, pepper and some lightly green tannins. It's a medium-bodied wine shows its varietal character, opens up for near term drinking but has the guts and structure to sock away for up to a decade.",89,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon,Waterbrook
US,"Not much going on in this flat, candy-sweet wine. It tastes like the liquid in canned peaches and pineapples.",82,18.0,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Silverado
US,"This dense Cab shows the power of a true mountain wine, with intensely concentrated fruit and a thick coating of tannins. Yet those tannins are finely ground and the texture is as smooth as velvet, making for instant drinkability. The flavors are of black currants, mocha, green olives and spicy oak. Drink this stylish Cab now and through 2012.",92,40.0,California,Mount Veeder,Cabernet Sauvignon,Cuvaison
US,"Though the nose seems dark and brooding with notes of black cherries, smoke and spice, on the palate, this is surprisingly light and fresh with a bright sour cherry acidity and soft tannins. There's a hint of green stems throughout this fairly light bodied wine.",84,22.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Merlot,Harbes Family Vineyard
US,"Another wine done in a fresh, spicy, bright style. Apple and light cinnamon, crisp and clean, make a wine perfect for summer sipping.",87,10.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay,RiverAerie
Italy,"Doesn't quite reach the heights of the 2000 edition, but it's still darn good, featuring finely tuned scents of dried fruit and spice that dance on the nose. In the mouth, it's a bit sweet, without the richness of texture to match, finishing with some dusty tannins. Best with hard cheeses.",89,47.0,Veneto,Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara",Il Roverone

Italy,"From the Bricco Boschis cru in Castiglione Falletto, this luminous Barolo offers pretty elements of wild berry, forest floor, leather, tar, licorice and eucalyptus.

US,"The complex blend of Bordeaux grapes does not quite jell into a wine with specific focus. It's dark and tastes of black cherry, with grainy tannins and a chalky finish. The acids are not well integrated and the wine seems disjointed in the finish.",85,30.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Claret,Matthews Estate

Italy,"Here's a slightly sweet, oak fermented 70-30 Vermentino-Viognier blend with a deep golden color and abundant notes of yellow fruit, vanilla, pine nut, mineral and some distant grassy shadings. It boasts surprising complexity and thick consistency: Just watch the glycerin move slowly down the sides of your glass. Not imported to the U.S.",88,24.0,Tuscany,Maremma,White Blend,Bruni

US,"Consulting winemaker Matthew Loso knows his way around a blend, and this fine Cabernet-Merlot mix shines with focused, dark fruit flavors. It's threaded with streaks of clove, black olive and anise, with real muscle and tannic heft.",91,19.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Elevation Cellars
Italy,"Big and clumsy upon opening, as nutty, earthy aromas dominate the fruit. Airing reveals lively black cherry and snappy plum flavors, but also a distant taste of sugar beet. Brightly acidic and almost tangy; it's obviously a good wine but it has a short zestiness that brings it down a notch.",87,65.0,Tuscany,Bolgheri,Sangiovese,Enrico Santini
US,"This is delicious, creamy and yeasty and loaded with citrus.  The midpalate expands into tropical fruit, vanilla bean and spice, and it's just flat-out delightful. Chill this one and try it out on any kind of food you can imagine; it just might work.",89,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),White Blend,Alexandria Nicole
US,"This 2004 is a really nice rendition of this wine, silky and seductive, almost soft upon entry but rich and intense with beautifully mixed flavors of baked fruits, cinnamon, smoke, coffee grounds, black tea, vanilla custard and a lick of butterscotch. In short, this is an extremely entertaining wine that showers the palate with a three ring circus of sensuous flavors.",94,60.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,Syrah,McCrea
US,"All estate grown, this blend is roughly half and half Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with a splash of Sangiovese. Dark and fruity, it opens generously with flavors of black cherry, cassis and a hint of cola, finishing with lick of dark chocolate. A mix of French, Hungarian and American oak—24% new—was used.",89,18.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Red Blend,Mannina Cellars
US,"Shows the acidity and firm tannins of this fine vineyard, and also the incredibly ripe fruit of the 2007 vintage. The combination of the two makes for a wine to cellar. It's dry and full-bodied, with masses of blackberries, black cherries, cola, licorice and sandalwood. Good now, with decanting, with roast lamb, but should begin to develop bottle complexity after 2012.",92,48.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Noir,Cambria
France,"A wood-fermented wine (in 225 litre barrels), this is naturally a rich Champagne.

Italy,"Light in color and lean in consistency, this is a refreshing white made from a traditional Sicilian variety called Grillo. Aromas of citrus, peach and stone fruit are clean and intense and the wine has a slightly sour touch on the finish.",86,8.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,Grillo,Feudo Arancio

Italy,"Beef jerky and smoked bacon come to mind and are followed by mellow tones of black cherry, ripe fruit and old spice. There's a sophisticated edge to this wine that helps it taste older than it actually is. It imparts flavors of sour cherry and tobacco leaf in the mouth.",85,24.0,Tuscany,Chianti Classico,Sangiovese,Fattoria di Cinciano
US,"This wine might be the poster child for the raging debate over high alcohol. With 15.7%, it certainly qualifies in that category. But it's also quite good, and has its place. It is dry and exuberant, with cherry, plum, currant and spice flavors, and as heady as it is, it will be fantastic with barbecue.",88,25.0,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel,Eno

US,"The grapes are from the estate in Yountville, just south of Oakville, and young Dominus always seems tight and austere. So it is here. Astringent tannins, youthful acids and new oak are upfront, raising the question of ageability. It's a roll of the dice. The wine is balanced and harmonious, but aggressive now.",87,109.0,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Dominus

US,"This is a good, young Oakville Cabernet, showing the firm tannins and black currant and cassis flavors you get from this splendid part of Napa Valley.

US,"Cor's Bordeaux blend is a mix of 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 28% Petit Verdot and 21% Malbec. Not surprisingly, the PV dominates, crafting a dark, earthy, coffee-scented wine.

The Brunate cru has awarded Vietti with a stellar product: a wine that is unusually dark and plush with impressive intensity and crafted aromas of black fruit, spice, earth, licorice, balsam and gianduia chocolate-hazelnut spread.

US,"As is typical of Pinots from this appellation, the wine is fruit-driven. We're talking a huge mouthfeel of cherry-rhubarb pie and oak-influenced cocoa-dusted peanut brittle flavors, but fortunately the wine is totally dry, and maintains a keen, acidic silkiness. Drink this big Pinot with strongly flavored food.",92,50.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Noir,Miner

Australia,"With this wine's lifted aromas and candied fruit, it's frankly a bit confectionary.

US,"This is Etude's inaugural bottling of this wine, a block designation from the estate. It shows not only classic Carneros quality, but something exotic. Dry and complex, the wine has cherry, cassis, raspberry and new oak flavors, with good acidity. That extra something is a feral, earthy quality, suggesting olive tapenade, sweet leather, tobacco and mushrooms that has got to come from terroir. Youthfully great now, and should age effortlessly for the next 8 to 10 years.",95,60.0,California,Carneros,Pinot Noir,Etude

France,"The smokiness that is apparent in many Chanson wines from this vintage is the dominant character in the bouquet of this big, burly wine. It has richness, a solid structure and some good, dense tannins. At the same time, the acidity reminds us of the freshness of the richest Pinot Noir.",88,73.0,Burgundy,Pommard,Pinot Noir,Chanson Père et Fils
Italy,"Easy and genuine, this unoaked expression of Syrah carries forth fresh aromas of blueberry, black cherry, spice and black pepper. It's an unassuming red wine that offers the pulp and consistency to pair with spaghetti and meat sauce.",86,10.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,Syrah,MandraRossa

Spain,"Toasty, yeasty and quite composed given the price point. If you like green apples, ripe pears or lychee fruit, chances are you're going to like this well-blended and fairly smooth Cava. It's persistent and structured enough to go with appetizers or main courses.",88,13.0,Catalonia,Cava,Sparkling Blend,Marqués de Gelida
US,"Mild kirsch and pink-grapefruit aromas open this medium-weight sparkler. The apple flavors and leesy accents have a softness on the palate that will give the wine mass appeal. The long finish has a fragrant, lingering sweet-tartness.",86,24.0,California,Napa Valley,Champagne Blend,Hagafen
US,"Rich and round, this young wine is still showing the edges of its new oak, but offers crisp apple and pear flavors along with the vanilla, toast and hazelnut of the wood, and balanced acidity. The sharpness should smooth out with additional bottle age.",88,13.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay,Covey Run

US,"Made from hand-picked grapes and unfiltered, this is a richly concentrated, full-bodied Merlot with an abundance of sweet, juicy black plum and freshly roasted coffee flavors.

A great pairing with roasted pork tenderloin.",87,19.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Merlot,Pindar Vineyards
Australia,"A wine that evolves through a few phases while in the glass, each more odd than the last. Starts off with a sold berry-and cream profile, straightforward and accessible. With time, the nose turns tomato-y, and the palate bubblegum-sweet, then a little green. Well made, but odd.",86,30.0,South Australia,Barossa Valley,Shiraz,The Colonial Estate
US,"A solid example of the variety, with complex red and black fruits mixing it up with additional grace notes of coffee, sweet spice, toast and licorice. It's a balanced effort, with rather delicate tannins, and a finish that quits just a little early.",89,30.0,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Syrah,RoxyAnn
US,"That terrific Santa Rita acidity is there, and the oak regimen tastes very expensive, but the fruit doesn't seem up to the task.

Rita Hills,Chardonnay,Testarossa
Italy,"Here's a pale and luminous rosé from Southern Italy with a pinkish-peach color and delicate aromas of stone fruit, wild berries, white cherries and a touch of chopped mint or basil. The wine is tart but also slightly sweet in the mouth and there's a touch of bitter almond on the close.",85,15.0,Southern Italy,Puglia,Rosé,Giordano
US,"Tough and earthy, with gritty tannins framing tobacco, black cherry and oak flavors. A good everyday Cab from this warmish appellation.",84,36.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Jacella
US,"A problematic wine. It's too tannic and closed to enjoy now, and the fruit flavor may not be powerful enough to withstand aging. Then there's the sweaty taste that provides a jarring note, and may be tamping down the fruit.",85,90.0,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon,Pine Ridge
Spain,"Minty black cherry aromas give it a solid opening, but there's also some mild cleanser and paint scents to the nose. The palate is basic, snappy, fresh and carries good weight, while the flavors are sweet, berry-oriented and softened by vanilla. A good Grenache with good balance.",87,16.0,Northern Spain,Calatayud,Garnacha,Bodegas Ateca

Spain,"Aromas of brick dust, vitamins and baked fruits are gritty and require some navigating. This has a wiry, tight feel, yet in terms of flavors, it's ripe almost to the point of being raisiny.

US,"Aged for a year in stainless-steel barrels, this wine is a combination of two vineyard blocks.

Italy,"Here's a Ribolla Gialla that seems much less generous on the nose than it is in the mouth.

It should be versatile with food.",89,34.0,California,Sierra Foothills,Touriga Nacional,Wise Villa

US,"Rambunctious and brawny, it's burly in dark color and oaky black cherry and blackberry, with a pastoral earthiness.

Spain,"Roasted and rubbery smelling, this has heavy oak influence that yields notes of mint and shoe. Shearing on the palate despite its body, this has flavors of oak-based vanilla, mint and sweet-and-sour plum.

Argentina,"This colorful, clumsy wine shows glaring powdered-drink and candied cherry aromas and flavors, and while it's kind of scouring and rough it manages to make its mark via its juicy ripeness.

US,"A blend of Cabernet, Syrah and Merlot, it's sappy and loaded with tart red fruits.

Australia,"Named for the famous Shiraz-growing district at the north end of the Barossa Valley, Penfolds' Kalimna Shiraz is in fact a multiregional South Australian blend that aims to recreate the Kalimna style.

Spain,"Starts out a bit rough and horsey, but let it air out and escape from the bottle and this Tempranillo-Cabernet blend struts its stuff.

If you drink it now, give it a good decanting.",90,37.0,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay,Marimar Estate
Italy,"This opens with a fragrant bouquet of white flower and honey, and it shows thick streaks of glycerine that run down the sides of the glass. The wine has the heft and staying power to pair with fried calamari rings.",87,15.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,Grillo,Altadonna
US,"This single-vineyard Zin is a considerable improvement over the ‘04. The alcohol in the ‘05 is far lower, almost a full percent, yielding a more balanced and harmonious wine. But it's hardly shy. It's powerful in wild blackberry, cassis, raspberry, root beer, tangerine, chocolate and sweet thyme, while the tannic structure is rich enough to warrant bottle aging for a decade.",92,45.0,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel,Williams Selyem
France,"A beautifully balanced non-vintage, in the lighter style that is Ayala's hallmark. It is fresh, but shows a good amount of blend with older wines to give weight and complexity. The green fruit flavors are well balanced with secondary aromas of almonds, green berries and lively, but not dominant acidity.",91,24.0,Champagne,Champagne,Champagne Blend,Ayala
Spain,"Dusty and neutral on the nose, with a hint of wild flower and mineral to stir interest. The palate is dry despite having some size and plumpness; flavors of apple, peach and papaya are crisp and lean.",85,13.0,Catalonia,Penedès,Muscat,Sumarroca
US,"A lovely Cabernet for drinking now with upscale fare, like steak. It's dry and smooth in the mouth, with velvety tannins, and the flavors are rich in black currants and mocha, with a touch of dried sage and cedar.",88,30.0,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Chateau St. Jean
France,"N.P.U. standing for Nec Plus Ultra (translation “nothing further beyond”), this is a ultra-dry Champagne. It needs time to mature, so Bruno Paillard is to be congratulated for only now releasing the 1995 vintage. It has richness and freshness, the white fruits still scintillating in the glass. With the acidity over the ripe fruits, this could certainly age over the next five years or more.",94,220.0,Champagne,Champagne,Champagne Blend,Bruno Paillard
US,"This 50-50 blend of Syrah and Zinfandel is quite successful. It's a full-bodied, lusty wine, dark and dry, whose considerable tannins frame flavors of blackberries, blueberries, leather, sweet currants, black pepper, Chinese Five Spice and cedar. A creative and likeable wine.",87,39.0,California,Paso Robles,Red Blend,Midnight
France,"Structured and very linear in character, this wine has weight within its solid texture. Spice and acidity feature in as well as red plums and a touch of red currant. It is still very young, needing several years. Drink from 2019.",92,84.0,Burgundy,Nuits-St.-Georges,Pinot Noir,Henri de Villamont

Italy,"Elvio Cogno is a winery to watch closely in the future. These are exciting wines, loaded with charm and personality. The 2005 Ravera cru expression is tightly packed with fragrant fruit, floral and spice aromas and the mouthfeel is smooth, silky and long. Drink after 2015.",91,24.0,Piedmont,Barolo,Nebbiolo,Elvio Cogno
US,"Here's a crisp, dry, young Sauvignon Blanc, with a little cat pee, but fortunately it's drowned in a flood of grapefruit, lime, passionfruit and fig flavors. Crisp acidity scours the palate and gets those tastebuds whistling.",85,18.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc,Sauvignon Republic
Australia,"Hyperperfumed, with billowing floral notes, raspberries and citrus that provide immediate impact. The sweet, fruity flavors are adequately balanced by bubbly froth, making for an easy-to-drink quaff. The gentle pink color is even reminiscent of summertime sunsets. Drink now.",87,14.0,Victoria,Victoria,Moscato,Innocent Bystander
US,". The winery's above-the-fog vineyard has been kind to Merlot, nearly always producing an interesting wine. The '05, from such a cool vintage, has given crisp, firm tannins, but long hangtime allowed the grapes to develop luscious blackberry flavors, which smoky oak perfectly accents. A wine of charm and depth; should develop bottle complexity over the next 6 years.",91,25.0,California,Mendocino Ridge,Merlot,Greenwood Ridge
US,"Made at an attractive price point, this wine delivers value and plenty of flavor, from blackberry jam to oak and black pepper. It's sturdy and structured, ready for the table or larger gathering.",90,24.0,California,Napa Valley,Merlot,Napa Cellars
US,"Clos du Bois may be jumping on the Grigio bandwagon, but at least winemaker Erik Olsen has turned out a solid example. Effusively fruity on the nose, bursting with ripe pear and melon flavors, this round, easy-drinking wine should be a summertime hit.",85,12.0,California,California,Pinot Grigio,Clos du Bois

US,"An inky black, brooding wine, thick and glyceriney, with massive aromas of baked pie-filling fruits and berries and caramelized oak.

Should develop well over the next 6 years.",92,65.0,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Noir,Standish

France,"A soft style of Sauvignon, hinting at tropical fruit, but guarding its fresh, green, herbaceous character. The wine is ultrafresh and with its texture of fruit skins is a likely wine for food. Screwcap.",87,12.0,Southwest France,Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne,Sauvignon Blanc,Domaine du Tariquet

US,"This is an elegant, supple Pinot Noir of great charm and impeccable balance. It's perfect for pairing with Ahi tuna, grilled or tartare. Made in a crisper, leaner, more acidic style, it's bone dry, with flavors of cherry pulp and skin, cola, bacon, sandalwood and Asian spices. Tasted twice. Drink now through 2013.",94,33.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Noir,Lane Tanner
US,"This is a dessert wine, and a very pleasurable one. It's sweet but not too sweet, and very high acidity provides crisp balance to the pineapple, peach, honeysuckle, vanilla and spice flavors. The official sugar reading is 7.5%, and the alcohol is a refreshingly low 9%. Great with a fruit tart, sorbet or Key lime pie.",90,16.0,California,Lake County,Muscat,Bonterra
US,"This is every bit the equal of, if not even a bit better than, the outstanding 2005 Novelty Hill Sauvignon Blanc. Here is the same mix of racy, bracing tropical and stone fruit flavors, nicely matched to toasty flavors of almonds and biscuits. Elegant, detailed and ripe, yet clearly varietal, this is a beautiful, seductive example of barrel-fermented Washington Sauvignon Blanc.",92,18.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sauvignon Blanc,Novelty Hill
US,"One of the winery's drier and more tannic wines, this Syrah, Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon blend comes from the Santa Ynez and Los Alamos valleys of Santa Barbara County. The big structure and slight astringency presently dominate a solid core of blackberries, grilled meat and black cherry jam. A dramatic wine, but still a little gritty after four-plus years. Drink now–2013.",92,70.0,California,California,Red Blend,Sanguis

US,"A pretty good Cab that shows plenty of richness. May lack a bit in nuance, but on the other hand, a little cellaring could benefit. As currently constructed, it's rich and forward in berry-cherry fruit and oak, with lots of spices, and tastes a bit jammy-sweet. Honig's single-vineyard Cabs always seem much better than their generic Napa Valley.",87,40.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon,Honig
Spain,"Hard and oily smelling, with an acrid overtone. The palate is grating and tastes of bitter, pithy citrus, while the finish is equally bitter, with grapefruit pith lasting too long. Expensive for what you get.",82,20.0,Northern Spain,Somontano,White Blend,Viñas del Vero

US,"Here's an extraordinarily rich, flavorful red wine and here's how you should use it. Take a slab of beef, give it a super spice rub, then grill it, maybe with some veggies, and enjoy. Nothing complicated here, just loads of fresh fruits, currants and spices, wrapped into sturdy tannins.",87,28.0,California,Sonoma County,Red Blend,Deerfield

Spain,"More in the Champagne style, meaning the nose is yeasty and toasty, and the color is more gold than pale yellow. The palate offers wholesome apple, lemon and green herb flavors, and the finish is dry and peppery, with some bitterness. Strives for more complexity than most cavas, and it gets there for the most part.",87,16.0,Catalonia,Cava,Sparkling Blend,Montsarra

US,"Shows pleasurable cherry, raspberry, blackberry, coffee, cola and dusty spice flavors that are complex in their own way. But the wine is overly soft in both tannins and acids, leaving all that fruit out there to fend for itself, without balancing structure.",84,40.0,California,Amador County,Zinfandel,Renwood

US,"Spring Valley Vineyard, now being dramatically expanded by new owners Ste. Michelle Wine Estates, sits in a unique spot in the Walla Walla appellation. Now, if only the powers-that-be could make these wines at moderate levels of alcohol. Yes, this is delicious. Loaded with raspberry jam, peppery spice, hints of caramel. But the alcohol blows out the detail. Please—pull it back.",88,50.0,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Syrah,Spring Valley Vineyard

Imported by Tempranillo, Inc.",91,77.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Tempranillo,Remírez de Ganuza

Drink up.",86,39.0,Provence,Côtes de Provence,White Blend,Domaines Ott

US,"This tastes sweeter than the very fine 2009 and 2010, but that may be because the fruit is so powerfully intense and pure.

France,Les Forts de Latour is at the level of some of the Médoc classed growths. This 2006 is wonderfully juicy with ripe fruit that floats above the dry structure.
